Returns parameters for a temperature- and salt-stratified seawater buoyancy model
with a `gravitational_acceleration` constant (typically called 'g'), and an
`equation_of_state` that related temperature and salinity (or conservative temperature
and absolute salinity) to density anomalies and buoyancy.

`constant_temperature` indicates that buoyancy depends only on salinity. For a nonlinear 
equation of state, `constant_temperature` is used as the temperature of the system.
`true`. The same logic with the role of salinity and temperature reversed holds when `constant_salinity`
is provided.

For a linear equation of state, the values of `constant_temperature` or `constant_salinity` are irrelevant;
in this case, `constant_temperature=true` (and similar for `constant_salinity`) is valid input.
