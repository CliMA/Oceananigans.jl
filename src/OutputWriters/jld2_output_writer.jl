Construct a `JLD2OutputWriter` for an Oceananigans `model` that writes `label, output` pairs
in `outputs` to a JLD2 file.

The argument `outputs` may be a `Dict` or `NamedTuple`. The keys of `outputs` are symbols or
strings that "name" output data. The values of `outputs` are either `AbstractField`s, objects that
are called with the signature `output(model)`, or `WindowedTimeAverage`s of `AbstractFields`s,
functions, or callable objects.

Keyword arguments
=================

    ## Filenaming

    - `prefix`: Descriptive filename prefixed to all output files.
    
    - `dir`: Directory to save output to.
             Default: "." (current working directory).

    ## Output frequency and time-averaging
    
    - `iteration_interval`: Save output every `iteration_interval` model iterations.
    
    - `time_interval`: Save output every `time_interval` units of `model.clock.time`.
    
    - `time_averaging_window`: Specifies a time window over which each member of `output` is averaged before    
                               being saved. For this each member of output is converted to 
                               `Oceananigans.Diagnostics.WindowedTimeAverage`.
                               Default `nothing` indicates no averaging.
    
    - `time_averaging_stride`: Specifies a iteration 'stride' between the calculation of each `output` during
                               time-averaging. Longer strides means that output is calculated less frequently,
                               and that the resulting time-average is faster to compute, but less accurate.
                               Default: 1.

    ## Slicing and type conversion prior to output

    - `field_slicer`: An object for slicing field output in ``(x, y, z)``, including omitting halos.
                      Has no effect on output that is not a field. `field_slicer = nothing` means
                      no slicing occurs, so that all field data, including halo regions, is saved.
                      Default: FieldSlicer(), which slices halo regions.

    - `array_type`: The array type to which output arrays are converted to prior to saving.
                    Default: Array{Float32}.

    ## File management

    - `max_filesize`: The writer will stop writing to the output file once the file size exceeds `max_filesize`,
                      and write to a new one with a consistent naming scheme ending in `part1`, `part2`, etc.
                      Defaults to `Inf`.
    
    - `force`: Remove existing files if their filenames conflict.
               Default: `false`.

    ## Output file metadata management
    
    - `init`: A function of the form `init(file, model)` that runs when a JLD2 output file is initialized.
              Default: `noinit(args...) = nothing`.
    
    - `including`: List of model properties to save with every file.
                   Default: `[:grid, :coriolis, :buoyancy, :closure]`

    ## Miscellaneous keywords

    - `verbose`: Log what the output writer is doing with statistics on compute/write times and file sizes.
                 Default: `false`.
    
    - `part`: The starting part number used if `max_filesize` is finite.
              Default: 1.
    
    - `jld2_kw`: Dict of kwargs to be passed to `jldopen` when data is written.
