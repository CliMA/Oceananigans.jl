Construct a `Checkpointer` that checkpoints the model to a JLD2 file every so often as
specified by `iteration_interval` or `time_interval`. The `model.clock.iteration` is included
in the filename to distinguish between multiple checkpoint files.

Note that extra model `properties` can be safely specified, but removing crucial properties
such as `:velocities` will make restoring from the checkpoint impossible.

The checkpoint file is generated by serializing model properties to JLD2. However,
functions cannot be serialized to disk (at least not with JLD2). So if a model property
contains a reference somewhere in its hierarchy it will not be included in the checkpoint
file (and you will have to manually restore them).

Keyword arguments
=================
- `iteration_interval`: Save output every `n` model iterations.
- `time_interval`: Save output every `t` units of model clock time.
- `dir`: Directory to save output to. Default: "." (current working directory).
- `prefix`: Descriptive filename prefixed to all output files. Default: "checkpoint".
- `force`: Remove existing files if their filenames conflict. Default: `false`.
- `verbose`: Log what the output writer is doing with statistics on compute/write times
  and file sizes. Default: `false`.
- `properties`: List of model properties to checkpoint. Some are required.
