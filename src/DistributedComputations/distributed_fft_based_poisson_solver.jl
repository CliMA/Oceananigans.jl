    DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver(global_grid, local_grid)

Return a FFT-based solver for the Poisson equation,

∇²φ = b
```

for `Distributed`itectures.

Supported configurations
========================

We support two "modes":

  1. Vertical pencil decompositions: two-dimensional decompositions in ``(x, y)``
     for three dimensional problems that satisfy either `Nz > Rx` or `Nz > Ry`.

  2. One-dimensional decompositions in either ``x`` or ``y``.

Above, `Nz = size(global_grid, 3)` and `Rx, Ry, Rz = architecture(local_grid).ranks`.

Other configurations that are decomposed in ``(x, y)`` but have too few `Nz`,
or any configuration decomposed in ``z``, are _not_ supported.

Algorithm for two-dimensional decompositions
============================================

For two-dimensional decompositions (useful for three-dimensional problems),
there are three forward transforms, three backward transforms,
and four transpositions requiring MPI communication. In the schematic below, the first
dimension is always the local dimension. In our implementation of the PencilFFTs algorithm,
we require _either_ `Nz >= Rx`, _or_ `Nz >= Ry`, where `Nz` is the number of vertical cells,
`Rx` is the number of ranks in ``x``, and `Ry` is the number of ranks in ``y``.
Below, we outline the algorithm for the case `Nz >= Rx`.
If `Nz < Rx`, but `Nz > Ry`, a similar algorithm applies with ``x`` and ``y`` swapped:

1. `first(storage)` is initialized with layout ``(z, x, y)``.
2. Transform along ``z``.
3  Transpose + communicate to `storage[2]` in layout ``(x, z, y)``,
   which is distributed into `(Rx, Ry)` processes in ``(z, y)``.
4. Transform along ``x``.
5. Transpose + communicate to `last(storage)` in layout ``(y, x, z)``,
   which is distributed into `(Rx, Ry)` processes in ``(x, z)``.
6. Transform in ``y``.

At this point the three in-place forward transforms are complete, and we
solve the Poisson equation by updating `last(storage)`.
Then the process is reversed to obtain `first(storage)` in physical
space and with the layout ``(z, x, y)``.

Restrictions
============

The algorithm for two-dimensional decompositions requires that `Nz = size(global_grid, 3)` is larger
than either `Rx = ranks[1]` or `Ry = ranks[2]`, where `ranks` are configured when building `Distributed`.
If `Nz` does not satisfy this condition, we can only support a one-dimensional decomposition.

Algorithm for one-dimensional decompositions
============================================

This algorithm requires a one-dimensional decomposition with _either_ `Rx = 1`
_or_ `Ry = 1`, and is important to support two-dimensional transforms.

For one-dimensional decompositions, we place the decomposed direction _last_.
If the number of ranks is `Rh = max(Rx, Ry)`, this algorithm requires that 
_both_ `Nx > Rh` _and_ `Ny > Rh`. The resulting flow of transposes and transforms
is similar to the two-dimensional case. It remains somewhat of a mystery why this
succeeds (i.e., why the last transform is correctly decomposed).
