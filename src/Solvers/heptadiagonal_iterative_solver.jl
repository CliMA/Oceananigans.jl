`HeptadiagonalIterativeSolver` is a framework to solve the problem `A * x = b`
(provided that `A` is a symmetric matrix).

The solver relies on sparse version of the matrix `A` which are defined by the
field matrix_constructors.

In particular, given coefficients `Ax`, `Ay`, `Az`, `C`, `D`, the solved problem will be

To have the equation solved on Center, Center, Center, the coefficients should be specified
as follows:

- `Ax` -> Face, Center, Center
- `Ay` -> Center, Face, Center
- `Az` -> Center, Center, Face
- `C`  -> Center, Center, Center
- `D`  -> Center, Center, Center

```julia
Axᵢ₊₁ ηᵢ₊₁ + Axᵢ ηᵢ₋₁ + Ayⱼ₊₁ ηⱼ₊₁ + Ayⱼ ηⱼ₋₁ + Azₖ₊₁ ηₖ₊₁ + Azₖ ηⱼ₋₁ 
- 2 ( Axᵢ₊₁ + Axᵢ + Ayⱼ₊₁ + Ayⱼ + Azₖ₊₁ + Azₖ ) ηᵢⱼₖ 
+   ( Cᵢⱼₖ + Dᵢⱼₖ/Δt^2 ) ηᵢⱼₖ = b
```

`solver.matrix` is precomputed with a value of `Δt = -1.0`

The sparse matrix `A` can be constructed with

- `SparseMatrixCSC(constructors...)` for CPU
- `CuSparseMatrixCSC(constructors...)` for GPU

The constructors are calculated based on the pentadiagonal coeffients passed as an input
(`matrix_from_coefficients`).

The diagonal term `- Az / (g * Δt²)` is added later on during the time stepping
to allow for variable time step. It is updated only when the previous time step 
is different (`Δt_previous != Δt`).

Preconditioning is done through the incomplete LU factorization. 

It works for GPU, but it relies on serial backward and forward substitution which are very
heavy and destroy all the computational advantage, therefore it is switched off until a
parallel backward/forward substitution is implemented. It is also updated based on the
matrix when `Δt != Δt_previous`
    
The iterative_solver used can is to be chosen from the IterativeSolvers.jl package. 
The default solver is a Conjugate Gradient (cg)
