Return a `HeptadiagonalIterativeSolver` to solve the problem `A * x = b`, provided
that `A` is a symmetric matrix.

The solver relies on a sparse version of the matrix `A` that is stored in `matrix_constructors`.

In particular, given coefficients `Ax`, `Ay`, `Az`, `C`, `D`, the solved problem is

```julia
    Axᵢ₊₁ ηᵢ₊₁ + Axᵢ ηᵢ₋₁ + Ayⱼ₊₁ ηⱼ₊₁ + Ayⱼ ηⱼ₋₁ + Azₖ₊₁ ηₖ₊₁ + Azₖ ηₖ₋₁ 
    - 2 ( Axᵢ₊₁ + Axᵢ + Ayⱼ₊₁ + Ayⱼ + Azₖ₊₁ + Azₖ ) ηᵢⱼₖ 
    +   ( Cᵢⱼₖ + Dᵢⱼₖ/Δt^2 ) ηᵢⱼₖ  = b
```

To have the equation solved at location `{Center, Center, Center}`, the coefficients must be
specified at:
- `Ax` -> `{Face,   Center, Center}`
- `Ay` -> `{Center, Face,   Center}`
- `Az` -> `{Center, Center, Face}`
- `C`  -> `{Center, Center, Center}`
- `D`  -> `{Center, Center, Center}`

`solver.matrix` is precomputed with a placeholder timestep value of `placeholder_timestep = -1.0`.

The sparse matrix `A` can be constructed with:
- `SparseMatrixCSC(constructors...)` for CPU
- `CuSparseMatrixCSC(constructors...)` for GPU

The matrix constructors are calculated based on the pentadiagonal coeffients passed as an input
to `matrix_from_coefficients` function.

To allow for variable time step, the diagonal term `- Az / (g * Δt²)` is only added later on
and it is updated only when the previous time step changes (`previous_Δt != Δt`).

Preconditioning is done through the various methods implemented in `Solvers/sparse_preconditioners.jl`.
    
The `iterative_solver` used can is to be chosen from the IterativeSolvers.jl package. 
The default solver is a Conjugate Gradient (`cg`):

```julia
solver = HeptadiagonalIterativeSolver((Ax, Ay, Az, C, D); grid)
```
