    solve_poisson_equation!(solver::PressureSolver{HorizontallyPeriodic, GPU}, grid)

Similar to solve_poisson_equation!(solver::HPPS{CPU}, grid) except that since
the discrete cosine transform is not available through cuFFT, we perform our
own fast cosine transform (FCT) via an algorithm that utilizes the FFT.

Note that for the FCT algorithm to work, the input must have been permuted along
the dimension the FCT is to be calculated by ordering the odd elements first
followed by the even elements. For example,

    [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h] -> [a, c, e, g, h, f, d, b]

The output will be permuted in this way and so the permutation must be undone.
