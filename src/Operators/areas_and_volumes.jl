Notes on generalization:

The operators in this file have been defined with the intent of implementing a vertically
stretched Cartesian grid. To generalize these operators to more general grids, numerous
new grid spacing operators will have to be defined which can be combined in a combinatorial
fashion to define new area and volume operators.

Generalizing to the somewhat simple case of non-uniform spacing in the x, y, and z involves
defining two grid spacings per dimensions, e.g. Δxᶜᵃᵃ for the distance between adjacent cell
faces and Δxᶠᵃᵃ for the distance between adjacent cell centers.

Generalizing to the more complex case of locally orthogonal grids such as the cubed sphere
may involve defining more grid spacing operators, potentially up to eight per dimension,
although not all may be used in practice.
