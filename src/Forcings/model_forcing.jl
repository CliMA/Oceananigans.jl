    regularize_forcing(forcing, field_name)

"Regularizes" or "adds information" to
user-defined forcing objects that are passed to the `IncompressibleModel`
constructor. `regularize_forcing` is called inside `model_forcing`.
We need `regularize_forcing` because it is only until `model_forcing` is called that
the *names* of various forcing fields are available. The `field_name` can be used to infer
the location at which the forcing is applied, or to add a field dependency
to a special forcing object, as for `Relxation`.
