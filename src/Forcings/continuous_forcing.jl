"""
    ContinuousForcing(func; parameters=nothing, field_dependencies=())

Construct a "continuous form" forcing with optional `parameters` and optional
`field_dependencies` on other fields in a model.

If neither `parameters` nor `field_dependencies` are provided, then `func` must be
callable with the signature

```julia
func(X..., t)
```

where, on a three-dimensional grid with no `Flat` directions, `X = (x, y, z)`
is a 3-tuple containing the east-west, north-south, and vertical spatial coordinates, and `t` is time.

Dimensions with `Flat` topology are omitted from the coordinate tuple `X`.
For example, on a grid with topology `(Periodic, Periodic, Flat)`, and with no `parameters` or `field_dependencies`,
then `func` must be callable

```julia
func(x, y, t)
```

where `x` and `y` are the east-west and north-south coordinates, respectively.
For another example, on a grid with topology `(Flat, Flat, Bounded)` (e.g. a single column), and
for a forcing with no `parameters` or `field_dependencies`, then `func` must be callable with

```julia
func(z, t)
```

where `z` is the vertical coordinate.


If `field_dependencies` are provided, the signature of `func` must include them.
For example, if `field_dependencies=(:u, :S)` (and `parameters` are _not_ provided), and
on a three-dimensional grid with no `Flat` dimensions, then `func` must be callable with the signature

```julia
func(x, y, z, t, u, S)
```

where `u` is assumed to be the `u`-velocity component, and `S` is a tracer. Note that any field
which does not have the name `u`, `v`, or `w` is assumed to be a tracer and must be present
in `model.tracers`.

If `parameters` are provided, then the _last_ argument to `func` must be `parameters`.
For example, if `func` has no `field_dependencies` but does depend on `parameters`, then
on a three-dimensional grid it must be callable with the signature

```julia
func(x, y, z, t, parameters)
```

With `field_dependencies=(:u, :v, :w, :c)` and `parameters` and on a three-dimensional grid,
then `func` must be callable with the signature

```julia
func(x, y, z, t, u, v, w, c, parameters)
```
