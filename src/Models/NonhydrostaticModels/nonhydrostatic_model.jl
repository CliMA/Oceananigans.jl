Construct a model for a non-hydrostatic, incompressible fluid on `grid`, using the Boussinesq
approximation when `buoyancy != nothing`. By default, all Bounded directions are rigid and impenetrable.

Keyword arguments
=================

  - `grid`: (required) The resolution and discrete geometry on which the `model` is solved. The
            architecture (CPU/GPU) that the model is solved on is inferred from the architecture
            of the `grid`. Note that the grid needs to be regularly spaced in the horizontal
            dimensions, ``x`` and ``y``.
  - `advection`: The scheme that advects velocities and tracers. See `Oceananigans.Advection`.
  - `buoyancy`: The buoyancy model. See `Oceananigans.BuoyancyModels`.
  - `coriolis`: Parameters for the background rotation rate of the model.
  - `stokes_drift`: Parameters for Stokes drift fields associated with surface waves. Default: `nothing`.
  - `forcing`: `NamedTuple` of user-defined forcing functions that contribute to solution tendencies.
  - `closure`: The turbulence closure for `model`. See `Oceananigans.TurbulenceClosures`.
  - `boundary_conditions`: `NamedTuple` containing field boundary conditions.
  - `tracers`: A tuple of symbols defining the names of the modeled tracers, or a `NamedTuple` of
               preallocated `CenterField`s.
  - `timestepper`: A symbol that specifies the time-stepping method. Either `:QuasiAdamsBashforth2` or
                   `:RungeKutta3`.
  - `background_fields`: `NamedTuple` with background fields (e.g., background flow). Default: `nothing`.
  - `particles`: Lagrangian particles to be advected with the flow. Default: `nothing`.
  - `velocities`: The model velocities. Default: `nothing`.
  - `pressures`: Hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic pressure fields. Default: `nothing`.
  - `diffusivity_fields`: Diffusivity fields. Default: `nothing`.
  - `pressure_solver`: Pressure solver to be used in the model. If `nothing` (default), the model constructor
    chooses the default based on the `grid` provide.
  - `immersed_boundary`: The immersed boundary. Default: `nothing`.
  - `auxiliary_fields`: `NamedTuple` of auxiliary fields. Default: `nothing`
