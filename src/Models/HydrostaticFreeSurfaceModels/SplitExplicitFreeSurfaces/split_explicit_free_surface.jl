Return a `SplitExplicitFreeSurface` representing an explicit time discretization of 
a free surface dynamics with `gravitational_acceleration`. The free surface dynamics are solved by discretizing:
```math
\begin{gather}
∂_t η = - \nabla ⋅ U, \\
∂_t U = - g H \nabla η + G^U,
\end{gather}
```
where ``η`` is the free surface displacement, ``U`` is the barotropic velocity vector, calculated as the vertical integral 
of the velocity field ``u`` and ``v``, ``H`` is the column depth, ``G^U`` is the slow forcing calculated as the integral of the 
tendency of ``u`` and ``v``, and ``g`` is the gravitational acceleration. 

The discretized equations are solved within a baroclinic timestep (``Δt``) by substepping with a ``Δτ < Δt``. 
The barotropic velocities are filtered throughout the substepping and, finally, 
the barotropic mode of the velocities at the new time step is corrected with the filtered velocities.

Keyword Arguments
=================

- `gravitational_acceleration`: the gravitational acceleration (default: `g_Earth`)

- `substeps`: The number of substeps that divide the range `(t, t + 2Δt)`, where `Δt` is the baroclinic
              timestep. Note that some averaging functions do not require substepping until `2Δt`.
              The number of substeps is reduced automatically to the last index of `averaging_kernel`
              for which `averaging_kernel > 0`.

- `cfl`: If set then the number of `substeps` are computed based on the advective timescale imposed from
         the barotropic gravity-wave speed that corresponds to depth `grid.Lz`. If `fixed_Δt` is provided,
         then the number of `substeps` adapts to maintain an exact `cfl`. If not, the effective cfl will
         always be lower than the specified `cfl` provided that the baroclinic time step satisfies
         `Δt_baroclinic < fixed_Δt`.

!!! info "Needed keyword arguments"
    Either `substeps` _or_ `cfl` need to be prescribed.
    
    When `cfl` is prescribed then `grid` is also required as a positional argument.

- `fixed_Δt`: The maximum baroclinic timestep allowed. If `fixed_Δt` is a `nothing` and a cfl is provided,
              then the number of substeps will be computed on the fly from the baroclinic time step to
              maintain a constant cfl.

- `averaging_kernel`: A function of `τ` used to average the barotropic transport `U` and the free surface
                      `η` within the barotropic advancement. `τ` is the fractional substep going from 0 to 2
                      with the baroclinic time step `t + Δt` located at `τ = 1`. The `averaging_kernel`
                      function should be centered at `τ = 1`, that is, ``∑ (aₘ m / M) = 1``, where the
                      the summation occurs for ``m = 1, ..., M_*``. Here, ``m = 0`` and ``m = M`` correspond
                      to the two consecutive baroclinic timesteps between which the barotropic timestepping
                      occurs and ``M_*`` corresponds to the last barotropic time step for which the
                      `averaging_kernel > 0`. By default, the averaging kernel described by [Shchepetkin2005](@citet)
                      is used.

- `timestepper`: Time stepping scheme used for the barotropic advancement. Choose one of:
  * `ForwardBackwardScheme()` (default): `η = f(U)`   then `U = f(η)`,
  * `AdamsBashforth3Scheme()`: `η = f(U, Uᵐ⁻¹, Uᵐ⁻²)` then `U = f(η, ηᵐ, ηᵐ⁻¹, ηᵐ⁻²)`.
