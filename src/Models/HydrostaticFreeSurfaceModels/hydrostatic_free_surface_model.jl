Construct an hydrostatic `Oceananigans.jl` model with a free surface on `grid`.

Keyword arguments
=================

    - `grid`: (required) The resolution and discrete geometry on which `model` is solved.
    - `architecture`: `CPU()` or `GPU()`. The computer architecture used to time-step `model`.
    - `gravitational_acceleration`: The gravitational acceleration applied to the free surface
    - `advection`: The scheme that advects velocities and tracers. See `Oceananigans.Advection`.
    - `buoyancy`: The buoyancy model. See `Oceananigans.Buoyancy`.
    - `closure`: The turbulence closure for `model`. See `Oceananigans.TurbulenceClosures`.
    - `coriolis`: Parameters for the background rotation rate of the model.
    - `forcing`: `NamedTuple` of user-defined forcing functions that contribute to solution tendencies.
    - `boundary_conditions`: `NamedTuple` containing field boundary conditions.
    - `tracers`: A tuple of symbols defining the names of the modeled tracers, or a `NamedTuple` of
                 preallocated `CenterField`s.
