Differentiation and interpolation operators

The geometry of the staggerd grid used by Oceananigans (the Arakawa C-grid)
is (in one dimension) shown below

face   cell   face   cell   face

        i-1            i
         ↓             ↓
  |      ×      |      ×      |
  ↑             ↑             ↑
 i-1            i            i+1

Difference operators are denoted by a `δ` (`\delta`). Calculating the difference
of a cell-centered quantity ϕ at cell i will return the difference at face i

    δϕᵢ = ϕᵢ - ϕᵢ₋₁

and so this operation, if applied along the x-dimension, is denoted by `δx_faa`.

The difference of a face-centered quantity u at face i will return the difference
at cell i

    δuᵢ = uᵢ₊₁ - uᵢ

and is thus denoted `δx_caa` when applied along the x-dimension.

The three characters at the end of the function name, `faa` for example, indicates that
the output will lie on the cell faces in the x-dimension but will remain at their original
positions in the y- and z-dimensions. Thus we further identify this operator by `_faa`
where the `a` stands for any as the location is unchanged by the operator and is determined
by the input.

As a result the interpolation of a quantity ϕ from a cell i to face i
(this operation is denoted "ϊx_faa" in the code below) is

    ϊx_faa(ϕ)ᵢ = (ϕᵢ + ϕᵢ₋₁) / 2

Conversely, the interpolation of a quantity u from a face i to cell i is given by

    ϊx_caa(u)ᵢ = (uᵢ₊₁ + uᵢ) / 2

The `ϊ` (`\iota\ddot`) symbol indicates that an interpolation is being performed.
`ϊx`, for example, indicates that the interpolation is performed along the x-dimension.
The three following characters in the interpolation function name indicate the
position that is being interpolated to following the same convention used for difference
operators.
