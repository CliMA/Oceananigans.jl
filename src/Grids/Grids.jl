"""
    Center

A type describing the location at the center of a grid cell.
"""

"""
	Face

A type describing the location at the face of a grid cell.
"""
struct Face end

"""
    AbstractTopology

Abstract supertype for grid topologies.
"""
abstract type AbstractTopology end

"""
    Periodic

Grid topology for periodic dimensions.
"""
struct Periodic <: AbstractTopology end

"""
    Bounded

Grid topology for bounded dimensions. These could be wall-bounded dimensions
or dimensions
"""
struct Bounded <: AbstractTopology end

"""
    Flat

Grid topology for flat dimensions, generally with one grid point, along which the solution
is uniform and does not vary.
"""
struct Flat <: AbstractTopology end

"""
    Connected

Grid topology for dimensions that are connected to other models or domains on both sides.
"""
const Connected = Periodic  # Right now we just need them to behave like Periodic dimensions except we change the boundary conditions.
