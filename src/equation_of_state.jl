Linear equation of state for seawater. Constants taken from Table 1.2 (page 33)
and functional form taken from Eq. (1.57) of Vallis, "Atmospheric and Oceanic
Fluid Dynamics: Fundamentals and Large-Scale Circulation" (2ed, 2017). Note
that a linear equation of state is not accurate enough for serious quantitative
oceanography as the expansion and contraction β coefficients vary with
temperature, pressure, and salinity.
