# ZStar vertical coordinate

The user can choose between a `ZCoordinate` and a `ZStar` vertical coordinate. A `ZStar` vertical coordinate conserves tracers
and volume with the grid following the evolution of the free surface in the domain. To obtain the (discrete) equations evolved 
in a general framework where the vertical coordinate is moving, we perform a scaling of the continuous primitive equations following ruldes to
