# Hydrostatic model with a free surface

The `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations under the 
Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations and with an arbitrary number of tracer conservation 
equations. Physics associated with individual terms in the momentum and tracer conservation
equations --- the background rotation rate of the equation's reference frame,
gravitational effects associated with buoyant tracers under the Boussinesq
approximation, generalized stresses and tracer fluxes associated with viscous and
diffusive physics, and arbitrary "forcing functions" --- are determined by the whims of the
user.

## Mass conservation and free surface evolution equation

The mass conservation equation is
```math
    0 = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{u} + \partial_z w \, .  
```

The above is integrated from the bottom of the fluid up to ``z = 0`` to obtain ``w(x, y, z, t)``.

The free surface displacement ``\eta(x, y, t)`` satisfies the linearized kinematic boundary 
condition at the surface
```math
    \partial_t \eta = w(x, y, z=0, t) \, .
```

## The momentum conservation equation

The equations governing the conservation of momentum in a rotating fluid, including buoyancy
via the Boussinesq approximation are
```math
    \begin{align}
    \partial_t \boldsymbol{u} & = - \left ( \boldsymbol{v} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \right ) \boldsymbol{u}
                        - \boldsymbol{f} \times \boldsymbol{u} 
                        - \boldsymbol{\nabla}_h (p + g \eta)
                        - \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\tau}
                        + \boldsymbol{F_u} \, , \label{eq:momentum}\\
                        0 & = b - \partial_z p \, , \label{eq:hydrostatic}
    \end{align}
```
where ``b`` the is buoyancy, ``\boldsymbol{\tau}`` is the hydrostatic kinematic stress tensor, 
``\boldsymbol{F_u}`` denotes an internal forcing of the velocity field ``\boldsymbol{u}``, 
``p`` is kinematic pressure, ``\eta`` is the free-surface displacement, and ``\boldsymbol{f}`` 
is the *Coriolis parameter*, or the background vorticity associated with the specified rate of 
rotation of the frame of reference.

Equation \eqref{eq:hydrostatic} above is the hydrostatic approximation and comes about as the 
dominant balance of terms in the Navier-Stokes vertical momentum equation under the Boussinesq 
approximation.

The terms that appear on the right-hand side of the momentum conservation equation are (in order):

* momentum advection: ``\left ( \boldsymbol{v} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \right ) 
  \boldsymbol{u}``,
* Coriolis: ``\boldsymbol{f} \times \boldsymbol{u}``,
* baroclinic kinematic pressure gradient: ``\boldsymbol{\nabla} p``,
* barotropic kinematic pressure gradient: ``\boldsymbol{\nabla} (g \eta)``,
* molecular or turbulence viscous stress: ``\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\tau}``, and
* an arbitrary internal source of momentum: ``\boldsymbol{F_u}``.

## The tracer conservation equation

The conservation law for tracers in Oceananigans.jl is
```math
    \begin{align}
    \partial_t c = - \boldsymbol{v} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} c
                   - \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{q}_c
                   + F_c \, ,
    \label{eq:tracer}
    \end{align}
```
where ``\boldsymbol{q}_c`` is the diffusive flux of ``c`` and ``F_c`` is an arbitrary source term.
Oceananigans.jl permits arbitrary tracers and thus an arbitrary number of tracer equations to 
be solved simultaneously with the momentum equations.

From left to right, the terms that appear on the right-hand side of the tracer conservation 
equation are

* tracer advection: ``\boldsymbol{u} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} c``,
* molecular or turbulent diffusion: ``\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{q}_c``, and
* an arbitrary internal source of tracer: ``F_c``.

The following subsections provide more details on the possible forms that each individual term 
in the momentum and tracer equations can take in Oceananigans.jl.
