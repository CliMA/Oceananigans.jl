# Stratified Couette flow

In regular plane Couette flow, a viscous fluid is situated between two infinite, parallel plates and usually the top
plate moves at some constant velocity generating a linear velocity profile in steady state
\citep[\S4.2--4.3]{Batchelor00}.

In stratified Couette flow, the plates are additionally held at fixed temperatures to provide a stable stratification.
It is a canonical geometry in which to investigate the dynamics of stratified shear flows as it exhibits a transition to
turbulence, intermittent turbulence, coherent structures, and diapycnal mixing among other rich behavior \citep{Zhou17}.

In this test we follow \citet{Vreugdenhil18} who use stratified Couette flow as a test of their large-eddy simulation
model. We will compare our results to theirs and the direct numerical simulation results of \citet{Deusebio15} and
\citet{Zhou17}.

In our setup replicating that of \citet{Vreugdenhil18}, a domain of size ``(L_x, L_y, L_z)/h = (4\pi, 2\pi, 2)``
is bounded in the vertical ``z``-direction by two infinite, parallel plates or walls at ``z = \pm h`` with horizontal
velocity ``u = \pm U_w`` and constant temperature ``\theta = \pm \Theta_w`` where ``\theta`` denotes temperature in this
section. The resulting flow is governed by the Reynolds, Richardson, and Prandtl numbers
```math
\text{Re} = \frac{U_w h}{\nu}, \quad
\text{Ri} = \frac{\alpha g \Theta_w h}{U_w^2}, \quad
\text{Pr} = \frac{\nu}{\kappa}
```
where ``\nu`` is the kinematic viscosity, ``\kappa`` is the thermal diffusivity, ``\alpha`` is the thermal expansion
coefficient, and ``g`` is the gravitational acceleration.

Defining horizontal averages for velocity ``U = \langle u \rangle`` and ``\Theta = \langle \theta \rangle`` we can
define the friction velocity ``u_\tau`` and friction temperature ``\theta_\tau`` at the wall by
```math
u_\tau^2 = \frac{\tau_w}{\rho_0}
         = \nu \left\vert \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \right\vert_{z = \pm h}, \quad
\theta_\tau = \frac{q_w}{u_\tau}
            = \frac{\kappa}{u_\tau} \left\vert \frac{\partial\Theta}{\partial z} \right\vert_{z = \pm h}
```
where ``\tau_w`` is the wall stress and ``q_w = u_\tau \theta_\tau`` is the wall heat flux.

From here the friction Reynolds number and the Nusselt number can be defined
```math
\text{Re}_\tau = \frac{u_\tau h}{\nu}, \quad \text{Nu} = \frac{q_w h}{\kappa \Theta_w}
```
which can be computed and compared.
