# Oceananigans.jl

*ðŸŒŠ Fast and friendly fluid dynamics on CPUs and GPUs.*

Oceananigans.jl is a fast and friendly fluid flow solver written in Julia that can be run in 1-3 dimensions on CPUs
and GPUs. It can simulate the incompressible Boussinesq equations, the shallow water equations, or the hydrostatic
Boussinesq equations with a free surface. Oceananigans.jl comes with user-friendly features for simulating rotating
stratified fluids including user-defined boundary conditions and forcing functions, arbitrary tracers, large eddy
simulation turbulence closures, high-order advection schemes, immersed boundaries, Lagrangian particle tracking, and
more!

We strive for a user interface that makes Oceananigans.jl`as friendly and intuitive to use as possible,
allowing users to focus on the science. Internally, we have attempted to write the underlying algorithm
so that the code runs as fast as possible for the configuration chosen by the user --- from simple
two-dimensional setups to complex three-dimensional simulations --- and so that as much code
as possible is shared between the different architectures, models, and grids.

## Getting help

If you are interested in using Oceananigans.jl or are trying to figure out how to use it, please feel free to ask us
questions and get in touch! If you're trying to set up a model then check out the examples and model setup
documentation. Please feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/discussions)
