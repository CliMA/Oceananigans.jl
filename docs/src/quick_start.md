# Quick start

This code:

```@setup cpu
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!(type = "png")
```

```@example cpu
using Oceananigans

grid = RectilinearGrid(size = (128, 128),
                       x = (0, 2Ï€),
                       y = (0, 2Ï€),
                       topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Flat))

model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, advection=WENO())

Ïµ(x, y) = 2rand() - 1
set!(model, u=Ïµ, v=Ïµ)

simulation = Simulation(model; Î”t=0.01, stop_iteration=100)
run!(simulation)
```

runs 100 time steps of a two-dimensional turbulence simulation with `128Â²` [finite volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method) cells
and a fifth-order upwinded [WENO advection scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WENO_methods).
It's quite similar to the [two-dimensional turbulence example](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/generated/two_dimensional_turbulence/).

## Visualization

They say that a [Makie](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/) visualization is worth a thousand Unicode characters, so let's plot vorticity,

```@example cpu
using CairoMakie

u, v, w = model.velocities
Î¶ = Field(âˆ‚x(v) - âˆ‚y(u))
compute!(Î¶)

heatmap(Î¶, axis=(; aspect=1))
```

A few more time-steps, and it's starting to get a little diffuse!

```@example cpu
simulation.stop_iteration += 400
run!(simulation)

compute!(Î¶)
heatmap(Î¶, axis=(; aspect=1))
```

## They always cheat with too-simple "quick" starts

Fine, we'll re-run this code on the GPU. But we're a little greedy, so we'll also
crank up the resolution, throw in a `TimeStepWizard` to update `simulation.Î”t` adaptively,
and add a passive tracer initially concentrated in the center of the domain
which will make for an even prettier figure of the final state:

```@setup gpu
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!(type = "png")
```

```@example gpu
using Oceananigans
using CairoMakie

grid = RectilinearGrid(GPU(),
                       size = (1024, 1024),
                       x = (-Ï€, Ï€),
                       y = (-Ï€, Ï€),
                       topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Flat))

model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, advection=WENO(), tracers=:c)

Î´ = 0.5
cáµ¢(x, y) = exp(-(x^2 + y^2) / 2Î´^2)
Ïµ(x, y) = 2rand() - 1
set!(model, u=Ïµ, v=Ïµ, c=cáµ¢)

simulation = Simulation(model; Î”t=1e-3, stop_time=10)
conjure_time_step_wizard!(simulation, cfl=0.2, IterationInterval(10))
run!(simulation)

u, v, w = model.velocities
Î¶ = Field(âˆ‚x(v) - âˆ‚y(u))
compute!(Î¶)

fig = Figure(size=(1200, 600))
axÎ¶ = Axis(fig[1, 1], aspect=1, title="vorticity")
axc = Axis(fig[1, 2], aspect=1, title="tracer")
heatmap!(axÎ¶, Î¶, colormap=:balance)
heatmap!(axc, model.tracers.c)
current_figure()
```

See how we did that? We passed the positional argument `GPU()` to `RectilinearGrid`.
(This only works if a GPU is available, of course, and
[CUDA.jl is configured](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/installation/overview/).)

## Well, that was tantalizing

But you'll need to know a lot more to become a productive, Oceananigans-wielding computational scientist (spherical grids, forcing, boundary conditions,
turbulence closures, output writing, actually labeling your axes... ðŸ¤¯).
It'd be best to move on to the [one-dimensional diffusion example](@ref one_dimensional_diffusion_example).
