# Fields basics

`Field`s and its relatives are core Oceananigans data structures.
`Field`s are more or less arrays of `data` located on a `grid`, whose entries
correspond to the average value of some quantity over some finite-sized volume.
`Field`s also may contain `boundary_conditions`, may be computed from an `operand` 
or expression involving other fields, and may cover only a portion of the total
`indices` spanned by the grid.

## Staggered grids and field locations

Oceananigans ocean-flavored fluids simulations rely fundamentally on
"staggered grid" numerical methods.

Recall that [grids](@ref grids_tutorial) represent a physical domain divided into finite volumes.
For example, let's consider a horizontally-periodic, vertically-bounded grid of cells
that divide up a cube with dimensions ``1 \times 1 \times 1``:

```jldoctest fields
using Oceananigans

grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded),
                       size = (4, 5, 4),
                       halo = (1, 1, 1),
                       x = (0, 1),
                       y = (0, 1),
                       z = [0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1])

# output
4×5×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 1×1×1 halo
├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 1.0) regularly spaced with Δx=0.25
├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 1.0) regularly spaced with Δy=0.2
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 1.0] variably spaced with min(Δz)=0.1, max(Δz)=0.4
```

The cubic domain is divided into a "primary mesh" of ``4 \times 5 \times 4 = 80`` cells,
which are evenly spaced in ``x, y`` but variably spaced in ``z``.
Now, in addition to the primary mesh, the grid defines also a set of "staggered" grids whose cells are
shifted by half a cell width relative to the primary mesh.
In other words, the staggered grid cells have a "location" in each direction -- either `Center`,
and therefore co-located with the primary mesh, or `Face` and located over the interfaces of the
primary mesh.
For example, the primary or `Center` cell spacings in ``z`` are

```jldoctest fields
zspacings(grid, Center())

# output
4-element view(OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, 0:5), 1:4) with eltype Float64:
 0.1
 0.19999999999999998
 0.3
 0.4
```

corresponding to cell interfaces located at `z = [0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1]`.
But then for the grid which is staggered in `z` relative to the primary mesh,

```jldoctest fields
zspacings(grid, Face())

# output
5-element view(OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, -1:5), 1:5) with eltype Float64:
 0.1
 0.15000000000000002
 0.24999999999999994
 0.3500000000000001
 0.3999999999999999
```

The cells for the vertically staggered grid have different spacings than the primary mesh.
That's because the _edges_ of the vertically-staggered mesh coincide with the _nodes_ (the cell centers)
of the primary mesh. The nodes of the primary mesh are

```jldoctest fields
znodes(grid, Center(), with_halos=true)

# output
6-element OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, 0:5) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:5:
 -0.05
  0.05
  0.2
  0.44999999999999996
  0.8
  1.2
```

The center of the leftmost "halo cell" is `z = -0.05`, while the center of the first cell from the left is `z = 0.05`.
This means that the width of the first cell on the vertically-staggered grid is `0.05 - (-0.05) = 0.1` -- and so on.
Finally, note that the nodes of the staggered mesh coincide with the cell interfaces of the primary mesh, so:


```jldoctest fields
znodes(grid, Center())

# output
4-element view(OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, 0:5), 1:4) with eltype Float64:
 0.05
 0.2
 0.44999999999999996
 0.8
```

In a three-dimensional domain, there are ``2³ = 8`` meshes -- 1 primary mesh, and 7 meshes that are
staggered to varying degrees from the primary mesh.
This system of staggered grids is commonly used in fluid dynamics and was [invented specifically for
simulations of the atmosphere and ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakawa_grids).

### Constructing Fields at specified locations

Every `Field` is associated with either the primary mesh or one of the staggered meshes by
a three-dimensional "location" associated with each field.
To build a fully-centered `Field`, for example, we write

```jldoctest fields
c = Field{Center, Center, Center}(grid)

# output
4×5×4 Field{Center, Center, Center} on RectilinearGrid on CPU
├── grid: 4×5×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 1×1×1 halo
├── boundary conditions: FieldBoundaryConditions
│   └── west: Periodic, east: Periodic, south: Periodic, north: Periodic, bottom: ZeroFlux, top: ZeroFlux, immersed: ZeroFlux
└── data: 6×7×6 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64, 3}, 0:5, 0:6, 0:5) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:5×0:6×0:5
    └── max=0.0, min=0.0, mean=0.0
```

Fully-centered fields also go by the alias `CenterField`,

```jldoctest fields
c == CenterField(grid)

# output
true
```

Many fluid dynamical variables are located at cell centers -- for example, tracers like temperature and salinity.
Another common type of `Field` we encounter have cells located over the `x`-interfaces of the primary grid,

```jldoctest fields
u = Field{Face, Center, Center}(grid)

# output
4×5×4 Field{Face, Center, Center} on RectilinearGrid on CPU
├── grid: 4×5×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 1×1×1 halo
├── boundary conditions: FieldBoundaryConditions
│   └── west: Periodic, east: Periodic, south: Periodic, north: Periodic, bottom: ZeroFlux, top: ZeroFlux, immersed: ZeroFlux
└── data: 6×7×6 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64, 3}, 0:5, 0:6, 0:5) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:5×0:6×0:5
    └── max=0.0, min=0.0, mean=0.0
```

which also goes by the alias `u = XFaceField(grid)`.
The name `u` is suggestive: in the Arakawa type-C grid ('C-grid' for short) used by Oceananigans,
the `x`-component of the velocity field is stored at `Face, Center, Center` location.

The centers of the `u` cells are shifted to the left relative to the `c` cells:

```jldoctest fields
@show xnodes(c)
@show xnodes(u)
nothing

# output
xnodes(c) = [0.125, 0.375, 0.625, 0.875]
xnodes(u) = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75]
```

Notice that the first `u`-node is at `x=0`, the left end of the grid, but the last `u`-node is at `x=0.75`.
Because the `x`-direction is `Periodic`, the `XFaceField` `u` has 4 cells in `x` -- the cell just right of `x=0.75`
is the same as the cell at `x=0`.

Because the vertical direction is `Bounded`, however, vertically-staggered fields have more
vertical cells than `CenterField`s:

```jldoctest fields
w = Field{Center, Center, Face}(grid)

@show znodes(c)
@show znodes(w)
nothing

# output
znodes(c) = [0.05, 0.2, 0.44999999999999996, 0.8]
znodes(w) = [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0]
```

`Field`s at `Center, Center, Face` are also called `ZFaceField`,
and the vertical velocity is a `ZFaceField` on the C-grid.
Let's visualize the situation:

```@setup fields
using Oceananigans
using CairoMakie
set_theme!(Theme(fontsize=24))
CairoMakie.activate!(type="svg")

grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded),
                       size = (4, 4, 4),
                       halo = (1, 1, 1),
                       x = (0, 1),
                       y = (0, 1),
                       z = [0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1])

c = CenterField(grid)

u = XFaceField(grid)
```


```@example fields
using CairoMakie

fig = Figure(size=(600, 180))
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel="x")

# Visualize the domain
lines!(ax, [0, 1], [0, 0], color=:gray)

xc = xnodes(c)
xu = xnodes(u)

scatter!(ax, xc, 0 * xc, marker=:circle, markersize=10, label="Cell centers")
scatter!(ax, xu, 0 * xu, marker=:vline, markersize=20, label="Cell interfaces")

ylims!(ax, -1, 1)
xlims!(ax, -0.1, 1.1)
hideydecorations!(ax)
hidexdecorations!(ax, ticklabels=false, label=false)
hidespines!(ax)

Legend(fig[0, 1], ax, nbanks=2, framevisible=false)

current_figure()
```

## Setting `Field`s

`Field`s are full of 0's when they are created, which is not very exciting.
The situation can be improved using [`set!`](@ref) to change the values of a field.
For example,

```jldoctest fields
set!(c, 42)

# output
4×5×4 Field{Center, Center, Center} on RectilinearGrid on CPU
├── grid: 4×5×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 1×1×1 halo
├── boundary conditions: FieldBoundaryConditions
│   └── west: Periodic, east: Periodic, south: Periodic, north: Periodic, bottom: ZeroFlux, top: ZeroFlux, immersed: ZeroFlux
└── data: 6×7×6 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64, 3}, 0:5, 0:6, 0:5) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:5×0:6×0:5
    └── max=42.0, min=42.0, mean=42.0
```

Now `c` is filled with `42`s (for this simple case, we could also have used `c .= 42`).
Let's confirm that:

```jldoctest fields
c[1, 1, 1]

# output
42.0
```

Looks good. And

```jldoctest fields
c[1:4, 1:5, 1]

# output
4×5 Matrix{Float64}:
 42.0  42.0  42.0  42.0  42.0
 42.0  42.0  42.0  42.0  42.0
 42.0  42.0  42.0  42.0  42.0
 42.0  42.0  42.0  42.0  42.0
```

Note that indexing into `c` is the same as indexing into `c.data`.

```jldoctest fields
c[:, :, :] == c.data
 
# output
true
```

We can also `set!` with arrays,

```@setup fields
using Random
Random.seed!(123)
```

```@example fields
random_stuff = rand(size(c)...)
set!(c, random_stuff)

heatmap(view(c, :, :, 1))
```

or even use functions to set,

```jldoctest fields
fun_stuff(x, y, z) = 2x
set!(c, fun_stuff)

# output

4×5×4 Field{Center, Center, Center} on RectilinearGrid on CPU
├── grid: 4×5×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 1×1×1 halo
├── boundary conditions: FieldBoundaryConditions
│   └── west: Periodic, east: Periodic, south: Periodic, north: Periodic, bottom: ZeroFlux, top: ZeroFlux, immersed: ZeroFlux
└── data: 6×7×6 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64, 3}, 0:5, 0:6, 0:5) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:5×0:6×0:5
    └── max=1.75, min=0.25, mean=1.0
```

```@setup fields
fun_stuff(x, y, z) = 2x
set!(c, fun_stuff)
```

and plot it

```@example fields
heatmap(view(c, :, :, 1))
```

For `Field`s on three-dimensional grids, `set!` functions must have arguments `x, y, z` for
`RectilinearGrid`, or `λ, φ, z` for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` and `OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid`.
But for `Field`s on one- and two-dimensional grids, only the arguments that correspond to the
non-`Flat` directions must be included. For example, to `set!` on a one-dimensional grid we write

```jldoctest fields
# Make a field on a one-dimensional grid
one_d_grid = RectilinearGrid(size=7, x=(0, 7), topology=(Periodic, Flat, Flat))
one_d_c = CenterField(one_d_grid)

# The one-dimensional grid varies only in `x` 
still_pretty_fun(x) = 3x
set!(one_d_c, still_pretty_fun)

# output
7×1×1 Field{Center, Center, Center} on RectilinearGrid on CPU
├── grid: 7×1×1 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Flat, Flat} on CPU with 3×0×0 halo
├── boundary conditions: FieldBoundaryConditions
│   └── west: Periodic, east: Periodic, south: Nothing, north: Nothing, bottom: Nothing, top: Nothing, immersed: ZeroFlux
└── data: 13×1×1 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64, 3}, -2:10, 1:1, 1:1) with eltype Float64 with indices -2:10×1:1×1:1
    └── max=19.5, min=1.5, mean=10.5
```

### A bit more about setting with functions

Let's return to the three-dimensional `fun_stuff` case to investigate in more detail how `set!` works with functions.
The `xnodes` of `c` -- the coordinates of the center of `c`'s finite volumes -- are:

```jldoctest fields
xc = xnodes(c)
@show xc
nothing # hide

# output
xc = [0.125, 0.375, 0.625, 0.875]
```

To `set!` the values of `c` we evaluate `fun_stuff` at `c`'s nodes, producing


```jldoctest fields
c[1:4, 1, 1]

# output
4-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.25
 0.75
 1.25
 1.75
```

!!! note
    This function-setting method is a first-order method for computing the finite volume
    of `c` to `fun_stuff`.
    Higher-order algorithms could be implemented -- have a crack if you're keen.

As a result `set!` can evaluate differently on `Field`s at different locations:

```jldoctest fields
u = XFaceField(grid)
set!(u, fun_stuff)
u[1:4, 1, 1]

# output
4-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0
 0.5
 1.0
 1.5
```

## Halo regions and boundary conditions

We built `grid` with `halo = (1, 1, 1)`, which means that the "interior" cells of the grid
are surrounded by a "halo region" of cells that's one cell thick.
The number of halo cells in each direction are stored in the properties `Hx, Hy, Hz`, so,

```jldoctest fields
(grid.Hx, grid.Hy, grid.Hz)

# output
(1, 1, 1)
```

`set!` doesn't touch halo cells.
Check out one of the two-dimensional slices of `c` showing both the interior and the halo
regions:


```jldoctest fields
c[:, :, 1]

# output
6×7 OffsetArray(::Matrix{Float64}, 0:5, 0:6) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:5×0:6:
 0.0  0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0
 0.0  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.0
 0.0  0.75  0.75  0.75  0.75  0.75  0.0
 0.0  1.25  1.25  1.25  1.25  1.25  0.0
 0.0  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  0.0
 0.0  0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0
```

The interior region is populated, but the surrounding halo regions are all 0.
To remedy this situation we need to `fill_halo_regions!`:

```jldoctest fields
using Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions: fill_halo_regions!

fill_halo_regions!(c)

c[:, :, 1]

# output
6×7 OffsetArray(::Matrix{Float64}, 0:5, 0:6) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:5×0:6:
 1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75
 0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25
 0.75  0.75  0.75  0.75  0.75  0.75  0.75
 1.25  1.25  1.25  1.25  1.25  1.25  1.25
 1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75
 0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25
```

The way the halo regions are filled depends on `c.boundary_conditions`:

```julia
c.boundary_conditions

# output
Oceananigans.FieldBoundaryConditions, with boundary conditions
├── west: PeriodicBoundaryCondition
├── east: PeriodicBoundaryCondition
├── south: PeriodicBoundaryCondition
├── north: PeriodicBoundaryCondition
├── bottom: FluxBoundaryCondition: Nothing
├── top: FluxBoundaryCondition: Nothing
└── immersed: FluxBoundaryCondition: Nothing
```

Specifically for `c` above, `x` and `y` are `Periodic` while `z` has been assigned
the default "no-flux" boundary conditions for a `Field` with `Center` location in
a `Bounded` direction.
For no-flux boundary conditions, the halo regions of `c` are filled so that derivatives evaluated
on the boundary return 0.
To view only the interior cells of `c` we use the function `interior`,

```jldoctest fields
interior(c, :, :, 1)

# output
4×5 view(::Array{Float64, 3}, 2:5, 2:6, 2) with eltype Float64:
 0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25
 0.75  0.75  0.75  0.75  0.75
 1.25  1.25  1.25  1.25  1.25
 1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75  1.75
```

Note that the indices of `c` (and the indices of `c.data`) are "offset" so that index `1`
corresponds to the first interior cell.
As a result,

```jldoctest fields
c[1:4, 1:5, 1] == interior(c, :, :, 1)

# output
true
```

and more generally

```jldoctest fields
typeof(c.data)

# output
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64, 3, Array{Float64, 3}}
```

Thus, for example, the `x`-indices of `c.data` vary from `1 - Hx` to `Nx + Hx` -- in this
case, from `0` to `5`.
The underlying array can be accessed with `parent(c)`.
But note that the "parent" array does not have offset indices, so

```jldoctest fields
@show parent(c)[1:2, 2, 2]
@show c.data[1:2, 1, 1]
nothing

# output
(parent(c))[1:2, 2, 2] = [1.75, 0.25]
c.data[1:2, 1, 1] = [0.25, 0.75]
```
