Oceananigans simulates the dynamics of ocean-flavored fluids by solving equations that conserve momentum, mass, and energy on a grid of finite volumes or "cells".
The first decision we make when setting up a simulation is: on what _grid_ are we going to run our simulation?
The "grid" captures the

1. The geometry of the physical domain;
2. The way that domain is divided into a mesh of finite volumes;
3. The machine architecture (CPU, GPU, lots of CPUs or lots of GPUs); and
4. The precision of floating point numbers (double precision or single precision).

We start by making a simple grid that divides a three-dimensional rectangular domain -- "a box" -- into evenly-spaced cells,

```jldoctest grids
using Oceananigans

grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded),
                       size = (16, 8, 4),
                       x = (0, 64),
                       y = (0, 32),
                       z = (0, 8))

# output
16×8×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo
├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 64.0) regularly spaced with Δx=4.0
├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 32.0) regularly spaced with Δy=4.0
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 8.0]  regularly spaced with Δz=2.0
```

This simple grid

* Has a domain that's "periodic" in ``x, y``, but bounded in ``z``.
* Has `16` cells in `x`, `8` cells in `y`, and `4` cells in `z`. That means there are ``16 \times 8 \times 4 = 512`` cells in all.
* Has an `x` dimension that spans from `x=0`, to `x=64`. And `y` spans `y=0` to `y=32`, and `z` spans `z=0` to `z=8`.
* Has cells that are all the same size, dividing the box in 512 that each has dimension ``4 \times 4 \times 2``.
  Note that length units are whatever is used to construct the grid, so it's up to the user to make sure that all inputs use consistent units.

In building our first grid, we did not specify whether it should be constructed on the [`CPU`](@ref) or [`GPU`](@ref).
As a result, the grid was constructed by default on the CPU.
Next we build a grid on the _GPU_ that's two-dimensional in ``x, z`` and has variably-spaced cell interfaces in the `z`-direction,

```jldoctest grids_gpu
using CUDA
architecture = GPU()
z_faces = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

grid = RectilinearGrid(architecture,
                       topology = (Periodic, Flat, Bounded),
                       size = (10, 4),
                       x = (0, 20),
                       z = z_faces)

# output
10×1×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Flat, Bounded} on CUDAGPU with 3×0×3 halo
├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 20.0) regularly spaced with Δx=2.0
├── Flat y
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 10.0] variably spaced with min(Δz)=1.0, max(Δz)=4.0
```

!!! note "GPU architecture requires a CUDA-, ROC- or Metal-enabled device"
    Running this example and creating a grid on the GPU requires a device that supports CUDA, ROC, or Metal. In other words, you must have an Nvidia, AMD, or Apple-compatible GPU available. For more information about CUDA, see the [`CUDA.jl` documentation](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/).

The ``y``-dimension is "missing" because it's marked `Flat` in `topology = (Periodic, Flat, Bounded)`.
So nothing varies in ``y``: `y`-derivatives are 0.
Also, the keyword argument (or "kwarg" for short) that specifies the ``y``-domains may be omitted, and `size` has only two elements rather than 3 as in the first example.
In the stretched cell interfaces specified by `z_interfaces`, the number of
vertical cell interfaces is `Nz + 1 = length(z_interfaces) = 5`, where `Nz = 4` is the number
of cells in the vertical.

A bit later in this tutorial, we'll give examples that illustrate how to build a grid thats [`Distributed`](@ref) across _multiple_ CPUs and GPUs.

## Grid types: squares, shells, and mountains

The shape of the physical domain determines what grid type should be used:

1. [`RectilinearGrid`](@ref Oceananigans.Grids.RectilinearGrid) can be fashioned into lines, rectangles and boxes.
2. [`LatitudeLongitudeGrid`](@ref Oceananigans.Grids.LatitudeLongitudeGrid) represents sectors of thin spherical shells, with cells bounded by lines of constant latitude and longitude.
3. [`OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid`](@ref Oceananigans.Grids.OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid) represents sectors of thin spherical shells divided with mesh lines that intersect at right angles (thus, orthogonal) but are otherwise arbitrary.

!!! note "OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids"
    See the auxiliary module [`OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids`](@ref)
    for recipes that implement some useful `OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid`s, including the
    ["tripolar" grid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999196901369).

For example, to make a `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` that wraps around the sphere, extends for 60 degrees latitude on either side of the equator, and has 5 vertical levels down to 1000 meters, we write

```jldoctest grids
architecture = CPU()

grid = LatitudeLongitudeGrid(architecture,
                             size = (180, 10, 5),
                             longitude = (-180, 180),
                             latitude = (-60, 60),
                             z = (-1000, 0))

# output
180×10×5 LatitudeLongitudeGrid{Float64, Periodic, Bounded, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo and with precomputed metrics
├── longitude: Periodic λ ∈ [-180.0, 180.0) regularly spaced with Δλ=2.0
├── latitude:  Bounded  φ ∈ [-60.0, 60.0]   regularly spaced with Δφ=12.0
└── z:         Bounded  z ∈ [-1000.0, 0.0]  regularly spaced with Δz=200.0
```

The main difference between the syntax for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` versus that for the `RectilinearGrid` are the names of the horizontal coordinates:
`LatitudeLongitudeGrid` has `longitude` and `latitude` where `RectilinearGrid` has `x` and `y`.

!!! note "Extrinsic and intrinsic coordinate systems"
    Every grid is associated with an "extrinsic" coordinate system: `RectilinearGrid` uses a Cartesian coordinate
    system `(x, y, z)`, while `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` and `OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid` use the geographic coordinates
    `(λ, φ, z)`, where `λ` is longitude, `φ` is latitude, and `z` is height.
    Additionally, `OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid` has an "intrinsic" coordinate system associated with the orientation
    of its finite volumes (which, in general, are not aligned with geographic coordinates).

    To type `λ` or `φ` at the REPL, write either `\lambda` (for `λ`) or `\varphi` (for `φ`) and then press `<TAB>`.

If `topology` is not provided for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`, then Oceananigans tries infer it: if the `longitude` spans 360 degrees,
the default `x`-topology is `Periodic`; if `longitude` spans less than 360 degrees `x`-topology is `Bounded`.

For example,

```jldoctest grids
grid = LatitudeLongitudeGrid(size = (60, 10, 5),
                             longitude = (0, 60),
                             latitude = (-60, 60),
                             z = (-1000, 0))

# output
60×10×5 LatitudeLongitudeGrid{Float64, Bounded, Bounded, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo and with precomputed metrics
├── longitude: Bounded  λ ∈ [0.0, 60.0]    regularly spaced with Δλ=1.0
├── latitude:  Bounded  φ ∈ [-60.0, 60.0]  regularly spaced with Δφ=12.0
└── z:         Bounded  z ∈ [-1000.0, 0.0] regularly spaced with Δz=200.0
```

is `Bounded` by default, because `longitude = (0, 60)`.

!!! note "LatitudeLongitudeGrid topologies"
    It's still possible to use `topology = (Periodic, Bounded, Bounded)` even if `longitude` doesn't span 360 degrees.
    But neither `latitude` nor `z` may be `Periodic` with `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`.

### Bathymetry, topography, and other irregularities

Irregular or "complex" domains are represented with [`ImmersedBoundaryGrid`](@ref), which combines one of the
above underlying grids with a type of immersed boundary. The immersed boundaries currently supported are:

1. [`GridFittedBottom`](@ref), which fits a one- or two-dimensional bottom height to the underlying grid, so the active part
   of the domain is above the bottom height.
1. [`PartialCellBottom`](@ref Oceananigans.ImmersedBoundaries.PartialCellBottom), which is similar to [`GridFittedBottom`](@ref),
   except that the height of the bottommost cell is changed to conform to bottom height, limited to prevent the bottom cells from becoming too thin.
3. [`GridFittedBoundary`](@ref), which fits a three-dimensional mask to the grid.

To build an `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`, we start by building one of the three underlying grids, and then embedding a boundary
into that underlying grid.

```jldoctest grids
using Oceananigans.Units

grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Bounded, Bounded, Bounded),
                       size = (20, 20, 20),
                       x = (-5kilometers, 5kilometers),
                       y = (-5kilometers, 5kilometers),
                       z = (0, 1kilometer))

# Height and width
H = 100meters
W = 1kilometer

mountain(x, y) = H * exp(-(x^2 + y^2) / 2W^2)
mountain_grid = ImmersedBoundaryGrid(grid, GridFittedBottom(mountain))

# output
20×20×20 ImmersedBoundaryGrid{Float64, Bounded, Bounded, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo:
├── immersed_boundary: GridFittedBottom(mean(z)=4.5, min(z)=0.0, max(z)=100.0)
├── underlying_grid: 20×20×20 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Bounded, Bounded, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo
├── Bounded  x ∈ [-5000.0, 5000.0] regularly spaced with Δx=500.0
├── Bounded  y ∈ [-5000.0, 5000.0] regularly spaced with Δy=500.0
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 1000.0]     regularly spaced with Δz=50.0
```

Yep, that's a Gaussian mountain:

```@setup grids
using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.Units

using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!(type = "svg")
set_theme!(Theme(fontsize=20))

grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Bounded, Bounded, Bounded),
                       size = (20, 20, 20),
                       x = (-5kilometers, 5kilometers),
                       y = (-5kilometers, 5kilometers),
                       z = (0, 1kilometer))

H = 100meters
W = 1kilometer

mountain(x, y) = H * exp(-(x^2 + y^2) / 2W^2)
mountain_grid = ImmersedBoundaryGrid(grid, GridFittedBottom(mountain))
```

```@example grids
using CairoMakie

h = mountain_grid.immersed_boundary.bottom_height

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[2, 1], xlabel="x (m)", ylabel="y (m)", aspect=1)
hm = heatmap!(ax, h)
Colorbar(fig[1, 1], hm, vertical=false, label="Bottom height (m)")

fig
```

## Once more with feeling

In summary, making a grid requires

* The machine architecture, or whether data is stored on the CPU, GPU, or distributed across multiple devices or nodes.
* Information about the domain geometry. Domains can take a variety of shapes, including
    - lines (one-dimensional),
    - rectangles (two-dimensional),
    - boxes (three-dimensional),
    - sectors of a thin spherical shells (two- or three-dimensional).
    Irregular domains -- such as domains that include bathymetry or topography -- are represented by using a masking technique to "immerse" an irregular boundary within an "underlying" regular grid. Part of specifying the shape of the domain also requires specifying the nature of each dimension, which may be
    - [`Periodic`](@ref), which means that the dimension circles back onto itself: information leaving the left side of the domain re-enters on the right.
    - [`Bounded`](@ref), which means that the two sides of the dimension are either impenetrable (solid walls), or "open", representing a specified external state.
    - [`Flat`](@ref), which means nothing can vary in that dimension, reducing the overall dimensionality of the grid.
* Defining the number of cells that divide each dimension. The number of cells, with or without explicit specification of the cell interfaces, determines the spatial resolution of the grid.
* The representation of floating point numbers, which can be single-precision (`Float32`) or double precision (`Float64`).

Let's dive into each of these options in more detail.

### Specifying the machine architecture

The positional argument `CPU()` or `GPU()`, specifies the "architecture" of the simulation.
By using `architecture = GPU()`, any fields constructed on `grid` store their data on
an Nvidia [`GPU`](@ref), if one is available. By default, the grid will be constructed on
the [`CPU`](@ref) if this argument is omitted.
So, for example,

```jldoctest grids
grid     = RectilinearGrid(size=3, z=(0, 1), topology=(Flat, Flat, Bounded))
cpu_grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(), size=3, z=(0, 1), topology=(Flat, Flat, Bounded))

grid == cpu_grid

# output
true
```

To use more than one CPU, we use the `Distributed` architecture,

```@example grids
using Oceananigans

child_architecture = CPU()
architecture = Distributed(child_architecture)
```

which allows us to distributed computations across either CPUs or GPUs.
In this case, we didn't launch `julia` on multiple processes using [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface),
so we're only "distributed" across 1 process.
For more, see [Distributed grids](@ref).

### Specifying the topology for each dimension

The keyword argument `topology` determines if the grid is
one-, two-, or three-dimensional (the current case), and additionally specifies the nature of each dimension.
`topology` is always a `Tuple` with three elements (a 3-`Tuple`).
For `RectilinearGrid`, the three elements correspond to ``(x, y, z)`` and indicate whether the respective direction is `Periodic`, `Bounded`, or `Flat`.
A few more examples are,

```julia
topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Periodic) # triply periodic
topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded)  # periodic in x, y, bounded in z
topology = (Periodic, Bounded, Bounded)   # periodic in x, but bounded in y, z (a "channel")
topology = (Bounded, Bounded, Bounded)    # bounded in x, y, z (a closed box)
topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Flat)     # two-dimensional, doubly-periodic in x, y (a torus)
topology = (Periodic, Flat, Flat)         # one-dimensional, periodic in x (a line)
topology = (Flat, Flat, Bounded)          # one-dimensional and bounded in z (a single column)
```

### Specifying the size of the grid

The `size` is a `Tuple` that specifies the number of grid points in each direction.
The number of tuple elements corresponds to the number of dimensions that are not `Flat`.

#### The halo size

An additional keyword argument `halo` allows us to set the number of "halo cells" that surround the core "interior" grid.
The default is 3 for each non-flat coordinate.
But we can change the halo size, for example,

```jldoctest grids
big_halo_grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Flat),
                                size = (32, 16),
                                halo = (7, 7),
                                x = (0, 2π),
                                y = (0, π))

# output
32×16×1 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Flat} on CPU with 7×7×0 halo
├── Periodic x ∈ [-6.90805e-17, 6.28319) regularly spaced with Δx=0.19635
├── Periodic y ∈ [-1.07194e-16, 3.14159) regularly spaced with Δy=0.19635
└── Flat z
```

The `halo` size has to be set for certain advection schemes that require more halo points than the default `3` in every direction.
Note that both `size` and `halo` are 2-`Tuple`s, rather than the 3-`Tuple` that would be required for a three-dimensional grid,
or the single number that would be used for a one-dimensional grid.

### The dimensions: `x, y, z` for `RectilinearGrid`, or `latitude, longitude, z` for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`

These keyword arguments specify the extent and location of the finite volume cells that divide up the
three dimensions of the grid.
For `RectilinearGrid`, the dimensions are called `x`, `y`, and `z`, whereas for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` the
dimensions are called `latitude`, `longitude`, and `z`.
The type of each keyword argument determines how the dimension is divided up:

* Tuples that specify only the end points indicate that the dimension should be divided into
  equally-spaced cells. For example, `x = (0, 64)` with `size = (16, 8, 4)` means that the
  `x`-dimension is divided into 16 cells, where the first or leftmost cell interface is located
  at `x = 0` and the last or rightmost cell interface is located at `x = 64`. The width of each cell is `Δx=4.0`.
* Vectors and functions alternatively give the location of each cell interface, and thereby may be used
  to build grids that are divided into cells of varying width.

## A complicated example: three-dimensional `RectilinearGrid` with variable spacing via functions

Next we build a grid that is both `Bounded` and stretched in both the `y` and `z` directions.
The purpose of the stretching is to increase grid resolution near the boundaries.
We'll do this by using functions to specify the keyword arguments `y` and `z`.

```jldoctest grids
Nx = Ny = 64
Nz = 32

Lx = Ly = 1e4
Lz = 1e3

# Note that j varies from 1 to Ny
chebychev_spaced_y_faces(j) = Ly * (1 - cos(π * (j - 1) / Ny)) / 2

# Note that k varies from 1 to Nz
chebychev_spaced_z_faces(k) = - Lz * (1 + cos(π * (k - 1) / Nz)) / 2

grid = RectilinearGrid(size = (Nx, Ny, Nz),
                       topology = (Periodic, Bounded, Bounded),
                       x = (0, Lx),
                       y = chebychev_spaced_y_faces,
                       z = chebychev_spaced_z_faces)

# output
64×64×32 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Bounded, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo
├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 10000.0)  regularly spaced with Δx=156.25
├── Bounded  y ∈ [0.0, 10000.0]  variably spaced with min(Δy)=6.02272, max(Δy)=245.338
└── Bounded  z ∈ [-1000.0, -0.0] variably spaced with min(Δz)=2.40764, max(Δz)=49.0086
```

```@setup plot
using Oceananigans
using CairoMakie
set_theme!(Theme(Lines = (linewidth = 3,)))
CairoMakie.activate!(type="svg")
set_theme!(Theme(fontsize=20))

Nx, Ny, Nz = 64, 64, 32
Lx, Ly, Lz = 1e4, 1e4, 1e3

chebychev_spaced_y_faces(j) = Ly * (1 - cos(π * (j - 1) / Ny)) / 2
chebychev_spaced_z_faces(k) = - Lz * (1 + cos(π * (k - 1) / Nz)) / 2

grid = RectilinearGrid(size = (Nx, Ny, Nz),
                       topology = (Periodic, Bounded, Bounded),
                       x = (0, Lx),
                       y = chebychev_spaced_y_faces,
                       z = chebychev_spaced_z_faces)
```

We can easily visualize the spacings of ``y`` and ``z`` directions. We can use, e.g.,
[`ynodes`](@ref) and [`yspacings`](@ref) to extract the positions and spacings of the
nodes from the grid.

```@example plot
yc = ynodes(grid, Center())
zc = znodes(grid, Center())

yf = ynodes(grid, Face())
zf = znodes(grid, Face())

Δy = yspacings(grid, Center())
Δz = zspacings(grid, Center())

using CairoMakie

fig = Figure(size=(1000, 1000))

axy = Axis(fig[1, 1], title="y-grid")
lines!(axy, [0, Ly], [0, 0], color=:gray)
scatter!(axy, yf, 0 * yf, marker=:vline, color=:gray, markersize=25)

axΔz = Axis(fig[4, 1]; xlabel = "z (m)", ylabel = "z-spacing (m)")
scatter!(axΔz, zc, Δz)
hidespines!(axΔz, :t, :r)

```

## Inspecting `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` cell spacings

```@setup latlon_nodes
using Oceananigans
```

```@example latlon_nodes
grid = LatitudeLongitudeGrid(size = (1, 44),
                             longitude = (0, 1),
                             latitude = (0, 88),
                             topology = (Bounded, Bounded, Flat))

Δx = xspacings(grid, Center(), Center())

using CairoMakie

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel="Zonal spacing on 2 degree grid (km)", ylabel="Latitude (degrees)")
scatter!(ax, Δx / 1e3)
fig
```

![](plot_lat_lon_spacings.svg)

## `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` with variable spacing

The syntax for building a grid with variably-spaced cells is the same as for `RectilinearGrid`.
In our next example, we use a function to build a Mercator grid with a spacing of 2 degrees at
the equator,

```jldoctest latlon_nodes
# Mercator scale factor
scale_factor(φ) = 1 / cosd(φ)

# Compute cell interfaces with Mercator spacing
m = 2 # spacing at the equator in degrees
function latitude_faces(j)
    if j == 1 # equator
        return 0
    else # crudely estimate the location of the jth face
        φ₋ = latitude_faces(j-1)
        φ′ = φ₋ + m * scale_factor(φ₋) / 2
        return φ₋ + m * scale_factor(φ′)
    end
end

Lx = 360
Nx = Int(Lx / m)
Ny = findfirst(latitude_faces.(1:Nx) .> 90) - 2

grid = LatitudeLongitudeGrid(size = (Nx, Ny),
                             longitude = (0, Lx),
                             latitude = latitude_faces,
                             topology = (Bounded, Bounded, Flat))

# output
180×28×1 LatitudeLongitudeGrid{Float64, Bounded, Bounded, Flat} on CPU with 3×3×0 halo and with precomputed metrics
├── longitude: Bounded  λ ∈ [0.0, 360.0]   regularly spaced with Δλ=2.0
├── latitude:  Bounded  φ ∈ [0.0, 77.2679] variably spaced with min(Δφ)=2.0003, max(Δφ)=6.95319
└── z:         Flat z
```

We've also illustrated the construction of a grid that is `Flat` in the vertical direction.
Now let's plot the metrics for this grid,

```@setup plot
# Mercator scale factor
scale_factor(φ) = 1 / cosd(φ)

# Compute cell interfaces with Mercator spacing
m = 2 # spacing at the equator in degrees
function latitude_faces(j)
    if j == 1 # equator

## Coordinate helper utilities

As described above, to construct grids with stretched coordinates we need to provide as input
either a function the returns the coordinate's interfaces or an array with the interfaces.

Here we further showcase some helper utilities that can be used to define few special types of
coordinates with variable spacings.

### Exponential coordinate

[`ExponentialCoordinate`](@ref) returns a coordinate with interfaces that lie on an exponential profile.
By that, we mean that a uniformly discretized domain in the range ``[l, r]`` is mapped back onto itself via either

```math
ξ \mapsto w(ξ) = r - (r - l) \frac{\exp{[(r - ξ) / h]} - 1}{\exp{[(r - l) / h]} - 1} \quad \text{(right biased)}
```

or

```math
ξ \mapsto w(ξ) = l + (r - l) \frac{\exp{[(ξ - l) / h]} - 1}{\exp{[(r - l) / h]} - 1} \quad \text{(left biased)}
```

The exponential mappings above have an e-folding controlled by scale ``h``.
It's worth noting that the exponential maps imply that the cell widths (distances between interfaces) grow linearly at a rate inversely proportional to ``h / (r - l)``.

The right-biased map biases the interfaces being closer towards ``r``; the left-biased map biases the interfaces towards ``l``.

At the limit ``h / (r - l) \to \infty`` both mappings reduce to identity (``w \to ξ``) and thus the grid becomes uniformly spaced.

!!! note "Oceanography-related bias"
    For vertical coordinates fit for oceanographic purposes, the right-biased mapping is usually more relevant as it implies finer vertical resolution closer to the ocean's surface.

```@example exponentialcoord
using Oceananigans.Grids: rightbiased_exponential_mapping, leftbiased_exponential_mapping

using CairoMakie

l, r = 0, 1

ξ  = range(l, stop=r, length=501)
ξp = range(l, stop=r, length=6)   # coarser for plotting

fig = Figure(size=(1200, 550))

axis_labels = (xlabel="uniform coordinate ξ / (r-l)",
               ylabel="mapped coordinate w / (r-l)")

axl = Axis(fig[1, 1]; title="left-biased map", axis_labels...)
axr = Axis(fig[1, 2]; title="right-biased map", axis_labels...)

for scale in (1/20, 1/5, 1/2, 1e12)
    label = "h / (r-l) = $scale"

    lines!(axl, ξ, leftbiased_exponential_mapping.(ξ, l, r, scale); label)
    scatter!(axl, ξp, leftbiased_exponential_mapping.(ξp, l, r, scale), markersize=20)

    lines!(axr, ξ, rightbiased_exponential_mapping.(ξ, l, r, scale); label)
    scatter!(axr, ξp, rightbiased_exponential_mapping.(ξp, l, r, scale), markersize=20)
end

Legend(fig[2, :], axl, orientation = :horizontal)

fig
```

Note that the smallest the ratio ``h / (r - l)`` is, the more finely-packed are the mapped points towards the left or right side of the domain.

Let's see how we use [`ExponentialCoordinate`](@ref). Below we construct a coordinate with 10 cells that spans the range ``[-700, 300]``. By default, the `ExponentialCoordinate` is right-biased.

```@example exponentialcoord
using Oceananigans

N = 10
l = -700
r = 300

x = ExponentialCoordinate(N, l, r)
```

Note that above, the default e-folding scale (`scale = (r - l) / 5`) was used.

We can inspect the interfaces of the coordinate via

```@example exponentialcoord
[x(i) for i in 1:N+1]
```

Being right-biased, note above how the interfaces are closer together near ``r``.

To demonstrate how the scale ``h`` affects the coordinate, we construct below two such exponential
coordinates: the first with ``h / (r - l) = 1/5`` and the second with ``h / (r - l) = 1/2``.

```@example exponentialcoord
using Oceananigans

N = 10
l = -700
r = 300
extent = r - l

using CairoMakie

fig = Figure(size=(1000, 1000))

scale = extent / 5
x = ExponentialCoordinate(N, l, r; scale)
grid = RectilinearGrid(; size=N, x, topology=(Bounded, Flat, Flat))
xc = xnodes(grid, Center())
xf = xnodes(grid, Face())
Δx = xspacings(grid, Center())

axx1 = Axis(fig[1, 1],  title = "scale = extent / 5")
lines!(axx1, [l, r], [0, 0], color=:gray)
scatter!(axx1, xf, 0 * xf, marker=:vline, color=:gray, markersize=25)
scatter!(axx1, xc, 0 * xc)
axΔx1 = Axis(fig[2, 1]; xlabel = "x (m)", ylabel = "x-spacing (m)")
lΔx = lines!(axΔx1, xf, Δx[1] .+ (xc[1] .- xf) * (extent / scale) / N, color=(:purple, 0.3), linewidth=4)
scatter!(axΔx1, xc, Δx)


scale = extent / 2
x = ExponentialCoordinate(N, l, r; scale)
grid = RectilinearGrid(; size=N, x, topology=(Bounded, Flat, Flat))
xc = xnodes(grid, Center())
xf = xnodes(grid, Face())
Δx = xspacings(grid, Center())

axx2 = Axis(fig[3, 1], title = "scale = extent / 2")
lines!(axx2, [l, r], [0, 0], color=:gray)

scatter!(axΔx2, xc, Δx)


legend = Legend(fig[5, :], [lΔx], ["slope = (extent / scale) / Nz"], orientation = :horizontal)

for ax in (axx1, axx2)
    hidedecorations!(ax)
    hidespines!(ax)
end

for ax in (axΔx1, axΔx2)
    ylims!(ax, -10, 450)
    hidespines!(ax, :t, :r)
end

A downside of [`ExponentialCoordinate`](@ref) coordinate is that we don't have tight control on the minimum spacing at the biased edge.
To obtain a coordinate with a certain minimum spacing we need to play around with the scale ``h`` and the number of cells.


### Constant-to-stretched-spacing coordinate

[`ConstantToStretchedCoordinate`](@ref) returns a coordinate with constant spacing over some extent and beyond
which the spacing increases with a prescribed stretching law; this allows a tighter control on the spacing at the biased edge.
That is, we can prescribe a constant spacing over the top `surface_layer_height`  below which the grid spacing
increases following a prescribed stretching law.
The downside here is that neither the final coordinate extent nor the total number of cells can be prescribed.
The coordinate's extent is greater or equal from what we prescribe via the keyword argument `extent`.
Also, the total number of cells we end up with depends on the stretching law.

As an example, we build three single-column vertical grids.
We use right-biased coordinate (i.e., `bias = :right`) since this way we can have tight control of the spacing at the ocean's surface (`bias_edge = 0`).
The three grids below have constant 30-meter spacing for the top 180 meters.
We prescribe to all three a `extent = 800` meters and we apply power-law stretching for depths below 120 meters.
The bigger the power-law stretching factor is, the further the last interface goes beyond the prescribed depth and/or with less total number of cells.

## Single-precision `RectilinearGrid`

To build a grid whose fields are represented with single-precision floating point values,
we specify the `float_type` argument along with the (optional) `architecture` argument,

```jldoctest grids
architecture = CPU()
float_type = Float32

grid = RectilinearGrid(architecture, float_type,
                       topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded),
                       size = (16, 8, 4),
                       x = (0, 64),
                       y = (0, 32),
                       z = (0, 8))

# output
16×8×4 RectilinearGrid{Float32, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo
├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 64.0) regularly spaced with Δx=4.0
├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 32.0) regularly spaced with Δy=4.0
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 8.0]  regularly spaced with Δz=2.0
```

!!! warn "Using single precision"
    Single precision should be used with care.
    Users interested in performing single-precision simulations should get in touch via
    [Discussions](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/discussions),
    and should subject their work to extensive testing and validation.

For more examples see [`RectilinearGrid`](@ref Oceananigans.Grids.RectilinearGrid)
and [`LatitudeLongitudeGrid`](@ref Oceananigans.Grids.LatitudeLongitudeGrid).

## Distributed grids

!!! note
    For the following examples, make sure to have both
    `Oceananigans` and `MPI` in your
    [environment](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/).

Next we turn to the distribution of grids across disparate nodes.
This is useful for running simulations that cannot fit on one node.
It can also be used to speed up a simulation -- provided that the simulation
is large enough such that the added cost of communicating information between
nodes does not exceed the benefit of dividing up the computation among different nodes.

```julia
# Make a simple program that can be written to file
make_distributed_arch = """

using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.DistributedComputations
using MPI; MPI.Init()
architecture = Distributed()
@onrank 0 @show architecture
@onrank 1 @show architecture
"""

write("distributed_arch_example.jl", make_distributed_arch)

# Run the program from inside julia.
# The program can also be run by exiting julia and running
#
# $ mpiexec -n 2 julia --project distributed_architecture_example.jl
#
# from the terminal.
using MPI
run(`$(mpiexec()) -n 2 julia --project distributed_arch_example.jl`)
rm("distributed_architecture_example.jl")
```

gives

```julia
architecture = Distributed{CPU} across 2 = 2×1×1 ranks:
├── local_rank: 0 of 0-1
├── local_index: [1, 1, 1]
└── connectivity: east=1 west=1
architecture = Distributed{CPU} across 2 = 2×1×1 ranks:
├── local_rank: 1 of 0-1
├── local_index: [2, 1, 1]
└── connectivity: east=0 west=0
```

That's what it looks like to build a [`Distributed`](@ref) architecture.
Notice we chose to display only if we're on rank 0 -- because otherwise, all the ranks print
to the terminal at once, talking over each other, and things get messy. Also, we used the
"default communicator" `MPI.COMM_WORLD` to determine whether we were on rank 0. This works
because `Distributed` uses `communicator = MPI.COMM_WORLD` by default (and this should be
changed only with great intention). See the [`Distributed`](@ref) docstring for more information.

Next, let's try to build a distributed grid:

```julia
make_distributed_grid = """

using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.DistributedComputations
using MPI; MPI.Init()

child_architecture = CPU()
architecture = Distributed(child_architecture)

grid = RectilinearGrid(architecture,
                       size = (48, 48, 16),
                       x = (0, 64),
                       y = (0, 64),
                       z = (0, 16),
                       topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded))

@handshake @info grid
"""

write("distributed_grid_example.jl", make_distributed_grid)

run(`$(mpiexec()) -n 2 julia --project distributed_grid_example.jl`)
```

gives

```
grid = 24×48×16 RectilinearGrid{Float64, FullyConnected, Periodic, Bounded} on Distributed{CPU} with 3×3×3 halo
├── FullyConnected x ∈ [0.0, 32.0) regularly spaced with Δx=1.33333
├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 64.0)       regularly spaced with Δy=1.33333
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 16.0]       regularly spaced with Δz=1.0
grid = 24×48×16 RectilinearGrid{Float64, FullyConnected, Periodic, Bounded} on Distributed{CPU} with 3×3×3 halo
├── FullyConnected x ∈ (32.0, 64.0) regularly spaced with Δx=1.33333
├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 64.0)       regularly spaced with Δy=1.33333
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 16.0]       regularly spaced with Δz=1.0
```

Now we're getting somewhere. Let's note a few things:

* For the second example, we explicitly specified `child_architecture = CPU()` to distribute
  the grid across CPUs. Changing this to `child_architecture = GPU()` distributes the grid across GPUs.

* We built the grid with `size = (48, 48, 16)`, but ended up with a `24×48×16` grid. Why's that?
  Well, `(48, 48, 16)` is the size of the _global_ grid, or in other words, the grid that we would get
  if we stitched together all the grids from each rank. Here we have two ranks. By default, the _local_
  grids are distributed equally in `x`, which means that each of the two local grids have half
  of the grids points of the global grid -- yielding local sizes of `(24, 48, 16)`.

* The global grid has topology `(Periodic, Periodic, Bounded)`, but the local grids have the
  topology `(FullyConnected, Periodic, Bounded)`. That means that each local grid, which represents
  half of the global grid and is partitioned in `x`, is not `Periodic` in `x`. Instead, the west
  and east sides of each local grid (left and right in the `x`-direction) are "connected" to another rank.

To drive these points home, let's run the same script, but using 3 processors instead of 2:

```julia
run(`$(mpiexec()) -n 3 julia --project distributed_grid_example.jl`)
```
gives

```
grid = 16×48×16 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Oceananigans.Grids.FullyConnected, Periodic, Bounded} on Distributed{CPU} with 3×3×3 halo
├── FullyConnected x ∈ [0.0, 21.3333) regularly spaced with Δx=1.33333
├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 64.0)          regularly spaced with Δy=1.33333
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 16.0]          regularly spaced with Δz=1.0
grid = 16×48×16 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Oceananigans.Grids.FullyConnected, Periodic, Bounded} on Distributed{CPU} with 3×3×3 halo
├── FullyConnected x ∈ [21.3333, 42.6667) regularly spaced with Δx=1.33333
├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 64.0)              regularly spaced with Δy=1.33333
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 16.0]              regularly spaced with Δz=1.0
grid = 16×48×16 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Oceananigans.Grids.FullyConnected, Periodic, Bounded} on Distributed{CPU} with 3×3×3 halo
├── FullyConnected x ∈ [42.6667, 64.0) regularly spaced with Δx=1.33333
├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 64.0)           regularly spaced with Δy=1.33333
└── Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 16.0]           regularly spaced with Δz=1.0
```

Now we have three local grids, each with size `(16, 48, 16)`.

### Custom partitions grids in both ``x`` and ``y``

To distribute a grid in different ways -- for example, in both ``x`` and ``y`` --
we use a custom [`Partition`](@ref).

The default `Partition` is equally distributed in `x`. To equally distribute in `y`, we write

```@setup grids
rm("partition_example.jl", force=true)
```

```julia
make_y_partition = """

using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.DistributedComputations: Equal
using MPI
MPI.Init()

partition = Partition(y=Equal())

if MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD) == 0
    @show partition
end
"""

write("partition_example.jl", make_y_partition)

run(`$(mpiexec()) -n 2 julia --project partition_example.jl`)
```

gives

```julia
partition = Partition across 2 = 1×2×1 ranks:
└── y: 2
```

#### Manually specifying ranks in ``x, y``

It's easy to manually configure `Partition(x=Rx, y=Ry)`, where `Rx * Ry` is the total number
of MPI ranks.
For example, `Partition(x=3, y=2)` is compatible with `a_program.jl` launched via

```bash
mpiexec -n 6 julia --project a_program.jl
```

#### Programmatically specifying ranks in ``x, y``

Programatic specification of ranks is often better for applications that need to scale.
For this the specification `Equal` is useful: if the number of ranks in one dimension is specified,
and the other is `Equal`, then the `Equal` dimension is allocated
the remaining workers. For example,

```@setup grids
rm("programmatic_partition_example.jl", force=true)
```

```julia
make_xy_partition = """

using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.DistributedComputations: Equal
using MPI
MPI.Init()

partition = Partition(x=Equal(), y=2)

if MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD) == 0
    @show partition
end
"""

write("programmatic_partition_example.jl", make_xy_partition)

run(`$(mpiexec()) -n 6 julia --project programmatic_partition_example.jl`)
```

gives

```
partition = Partition across 2 = 3×2×1 ranks:
├── x: 3
└── y: 2
```

Finally, we can use `Equal` to partition a grid evenly in ``x, y``:

```@setup grids
rm("equally_partitioned_grids.jl", force=true)
```

```julia
partitioned_grid_example = """

using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.DistributedComputations: Equal, barrier!
using MPI
MPI.Init()

# Total number of ranks
Nr = MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD)

# Allocate half the ranks to y, and the rest to x
Rx = Nr ÷ 2
partition = Partition(x=Rx, y=Equal())
arch = Distributed(CPU(); partition)

grid = RectilinearGrid(arch,
                       size = (48, 48, 16),
