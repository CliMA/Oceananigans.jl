# Staggered grid

Velocities $u$, $v$, and $w$ are defined on the faces of the cells, which are coincident with three orthogonal
coordinate axes (the Cartesian axes in the case of Oceananigans). Pressure $p$ and tracers $c$ are stored at
the cell  centers as cell averages. See figure \ref{fig:staggered_grid} for a schematic of the different control
volumes. Other quantities may be defined at other locations. For example, vorticity $\bm{\omega} = \nabla\times\bm{u}$
is defined at the cell edges.[^1]

[^1]: In 2D it would more correct to say the cell corners. In 3D, variables like vorticity lie at the same vertical
    levels as the cell-centered variables and so they really lie at the cell edges.

*Figure 1: A schematic of the control volumes in a two-dimensional staggered grid. Note that pressure $p$
(and tracers) is defined at the center of the control volume. The $u$ control volumes are centered on the
left and right edges of the pressure control volume while the $v$ control volumes are centered on the top
and bottom edges of the pressure control volumes. Figure credit: \citet{Kumar16}*

This staggered arrangement of variables is more complicated than the collocated grid arrangement but is greatly
beneficial as it avoids the odd-even decoupling between the pressure and velocity if they are stored at the same
positions. \citet[\S6.1]{Patankar80} discusses this problem in the presence of a zigzag pressure field: on a 1D
collocated grid the velocity at the point $i$ is influenced by the pressure at points $i-1$ and $i+1$, and a zigzag
pressure field will be felt as a uniform pressure, which is obviously wrong and would reduce the accuracy of the
solution. The pressure is effectively taken from a coarser grid than what is actually used. The basic problem is that
the momentum equations will use the pressure difference between two alternate points when it should be using two
adjacent points.

From the viewpoint of linear algebra, these spurious pressure modes correspond to solutions in the null space of the
pressure projection operator with eigenvalue zero and are thus indistinguishable from a uniform pressure field
\citep{Sani81}.

The staggered grid was first introduced by \citet{Harlow65} with their \emph{marker and cell} method. In meteorology
and oceanography, the staggered grid is usually referred to as the Arakawa C-grid after \citet{Arakawa77}, who
investigated four different staggered grids and the unstaggered A-grid for use in an atmospheric model.

\citet{Arakawa77} investigated the dispersion relation of intertia-gravity waves[^2] travelling in the $x$-direction
```math
  \omega^2 = f^2 + gHk^2
```
in the linearized rotating shallow-water equations for five grids. Here $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $H$ is the
height of the fluid and $k$ is the wavenumber in the $x$-direction. Looking at the effect of spatial discretization
error on the frequency of these waves they find that the B and C-grids reproduce the dispersion relation most closely
out of the five \citep[Figure 5]{Arakawa77}. In particular, the dispersion relation for the C-grid is given by
```math
  \omega^2 = f^2 \left[ \cos^2 \left( \frac{k\Delta}{2} \right)
             + 4 \left( \frac{\lambda}{\Delta} \right)^2 \sin^2 \left( \frac{k\Delta}{2} \right) \right]
```
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $\Delta$ is the grid spacing. Paraphrasing \citet[p. 184]{Arakawa77}: The
wavelength of the shortest resolvable wave is $2\Delta$ with corresponding wavenumber $k = \pi/\Delta$ so it is
sufficient to evaluate the dispersion relation over the range $0 < k\Delta < \pi$. The frequency is monotonically
increasing for $\lambda/\Delta > \frac{1}{2}$ and monotonically decreasing for $\lambda/\Delta < \frac{1}{2}$. For the
fourth smallest wave $\lambda/\Delta = \frac{1}{2}$ we get $\omega^2 = f^2$ which matches the $k = 0$ wave. Furthermore,
the group velocity is zero for all $k$. On the other grids, waves with $k\Delta = \pi$ can behave like pure intertial
oscillations or stationary waves, which is bad.

The B and C-grids are less oscillatory than the others and quite faithfully simulate geostrophic adjustment. However,
the C-grid is the only one that faithfully reproduces the two-dimensional dispersion relation $\omega^2(k, \ell)$, all
the other grids have false maxima, and so \citet{Arakawa77} conclude that the C-grid is best for simulating geostrophic
adjustment except for abnormal situations in which $\lambda/\Delta$ is less than or close to 1. This seems to have held
true for most atmospheric and oceanographic simulations as the C-grid is popular and widely used.
