# Checkpointing

A checkpointer can be used to serialize the entire model state to a file from which the model
can be restored at any time. This is useful if you'd like to periodically checkpoint when running
long simulations in case of crashes or cluster time limits, but also if you'd like to restore
from a checkpoint and try out multiple scenarios.

For example, to periodically checkpoint the model state to disk every 1,000,000 seconds of simulation
time to files of the form `model_checkpoint_iteration12500.jld2` where `12500` is the iteration
number (automatically filled in)

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
    using Oceananigans
end
```

```@repl checkpointing
using Oceananigans, Oceananigans.Units

model = NonhydrostaticModel(grid=RectilinearGrid(size=(16, 16, 16), extent=(1, 1, 1)))

simulation = Simulation(model, Î”t=1, stop_iteration=1)

simulation.output_writers[:checkpointer] = Checkpointer(model, schedule=TimeInterval(5years), prefix="model_checkpoint")

run!(simulation)
```

The default options should provide checkpoint files that are easy to restore from in most cases.
For more advanced options and features, see [`Checkpointer`](@ref).

## Picking up a simulation from a checkpoint file

Picking up a simulation from a checkpoint requires the original script that was used to generate
the checkpoint data. Change the first instance of [`run!`](@ref) in the script to take `pickup=true`:

```@repl checkpointing
simulation.stop_iteration = 2

run!(simulation, pickup=true)
```

which finds the latest checkpoint file in the current working directory (in this trivial case,
this is the checkpoint associated with iteration 0), loads prognostic fields and their tendencies
from file, resets the model clock and iteration, and updates the model auxiliary state before
starting the time-stepping loop.

Use `pickup=iteration`, where `iteration` is an `Integer`, to pick up from a specific iteration.
Or, use `pickup=filepath`, where `filepath` is a string, to pickup from a specific file located
at `filepath`.
