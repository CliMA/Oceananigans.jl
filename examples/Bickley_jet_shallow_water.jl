# # An unstable Bickley jet in Shallow Water model 
#
# This example shows how to use `Oceananigans.ShallowWaterModel` to simulate
# the evolution of an unstable, geostrophically balanced, Bickley jet.
# The model solves the governing equations for the shallow water model in
# conservative form.  The geometry is that of a periodic channel
# in the ``x``-direction with a flat bottom and a free-surface.  The initial
# conditions are that of a Bickley jet with small amplitude perturbations.
# The interested reader can see ["The nonlinear evolution of barotropically unstable jets," J. Phys. Oceanogr. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(2003)033<2173:TNEOBU>2.0.CO;2)
# for more details on this specific problem. 
#
# Unlike the other models, the fields that are simulated are the mass transports, 
# ``uh`` and ``vh`` in the ``x`` and ``y`` directions, respectively,
# and the height ``h``.  Note that the velocities ``u`` and ``v`` are not state 
# variables but can be easily computed when needed, e.g., via `u = uh / h`.
#
# ## Install dependencies
#
# First we make sure that we have all of the packages that are required to
# run the simulation.
# ```julia
# using Pkg
# pkg"add Oceananigans, NCDatasets, Plots, Printf, Polynomials"

# ## Two-dimensional domain 
#
# The shallow water model is a two-dimensional model and thus the number of vertical
# points `Nz` must be set to one.  Note that ``L_z`` is the mean depth of the fluid.

# ## Physical parameters
#
# This is a toy problem and we choose the parameters so this jet idealizes
# a relatively narrow mesoscale jet.   
# The physical parameters are
#
#   * ``f``: Coriolis parameter
#   * ``g``: Acceleration due to gravity
#   * ``U``: Maximum jet speed
#   * ``\Delta\eta``: Maximum free-surface deformation that is dictated by geostrophy
#   * ``\epsilon`` : Amplitude of the perturbation

# ## Building a `ShallowWaterModel`
#
# We use `grid`, `coriolis` and `gravitational_acceleration` to build the model.
# Furthermore, we specify `RungeKutta3` for time-stepping and `WENO5` for advection.

# ## Background state and perturbation
#
# The background velocity ``\overline{u}`` and free-surface ``\overline{\eta}`` are chosen to 
# represent a geostrophically balanced Bickely jet with maximum speed of ``U`` and 
# maximum free-surface deformation of ``Δη``, i.e.,
#
# ```math
# \overline{\eta}(y) = - Δη \tanh(y) , \\
# \overline{u}(y) = U \mathrm{sech}^2(y) .
# ```
# 
# The vorticity of the background state is ``Ω = - \partial_y \overline{u} = 2 U \mathrm{sech}^2(y) \tanh(y)``.
#
# Linear stability theory predicts that for the particular parameters that we consider here,
# the growth rate for the maximum growth rate should be ``0.14``.
# 
# We specify `Ω` to be the background vorticity of the jet in the absence of any perturbations.
# The initial conditions include a small-ampitude perturbation that decays away from the center
# of the jet.

# ## Running a `Simulation`
#
# We pick the time-step so that we make sure we resolve the surface gravity waves, which 
# propagate with speed of the order ``\sqrt{g L_z}``. That is, with `Δt = 1e-2` we ensure 
# that `` \sqrt{g L_z} Δt / Δx,  \sqrt{g L_z} Δt / Δy < 0.7``.
