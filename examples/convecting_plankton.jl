# # Plankton mixing and blooming
#
# In this example, we simulate the mixing of phytoplankton by convection
# that decreases in time and eventually shuts off, thereby precipitating a
# phytoplankton bloom. A similar scenario was simulated by
# [Taylor and Ferrari (2011)](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.2011.56.6.2293),
# providing evidence that the
# ["critical turbulence hypothesis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_depth#Critical_Turbulence_Hypothesis)
# explains the explosive bloom of oceanic phytoplankton
# observed in spring.
#
# The phytoplankton in our model are advected, diffuse, grow, and die according to
#
# ```math
# ∂_t P + \boldsymbol{v \cdot \nabla} P - κ ∇²P = [μ₀ \exp(z / λ) - m] \, P \, ,
# ```
#
# where ``\boldsymbol{v}`` is the turbulent velocity field, ``κ`` is an isotropic diffusivity,
#  ``μ₀`` is the phytoplankton growth rate at the surface, ``λ`` is the scale over
# which sunlight attenuates away from the surface, and ``m`` is the mortality rate
# of phytoplankton due to viruses and grazing by zooplankton. We use Oceananigans'
# `Forcing` abstraction to implement the phytoplankton dynamics described by the right
# side of the phytoplankton equation above.
#
# This example demonstrates
#
#   * How to use a user-defined forcing function to
#     simulate the dynamics of phytoplankton growth in sunlight
#     and grazing by zooplankton.
#   * How to set time-dependent boundary conditions.
#   * How to use the `TimeStepWizard` to adapt the simulation time-step.
#   * How to use `Average` to diagnose spatial averages of model fields.

# ## Install dependencies
#
# First let's make sure we have all required packages installed.

# ```julia
# using Pkg
# pkg"add Oceananigans, CairoMakie"
# ```

# ## The grid
#
# We use a two-dimensional grid with 64² points, 3² halo points for high-order advection,
# 1 m grid spacing, and a `Flat` `y`-direction:

using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.Units: minutes, hour, hours, day

grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(64, 64), extent=(64, 64), halo=(3, 3), topology=(Periodic, Flat, Bounded))

# ## Boundary conditions
#
# We impose a surface buoyancy flux that's initially constant and then decays to zero,

buoyancy_flux(x, t, params) = params.initial_buoyancy_flux * exp(-t^4 / (24 * params.shut_off_time^4))

buoyancy_flux_parameters = (initial_buoyancy_flux = 1e-8, # m² s⁻³
                                    shut_off_time = 2hours)

buoyancy_flux_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(buoyancy_flux, parameters = buoyancy_flux_parameters)

# The fourth power in the argument of `exp` above helps keep the buoyancy flux relatively
# constant during the first phase of the simulation. We produce a plot of this time-dependent
# buoyancy flux for the visually-oriented,

# The buoyancy flux effectively shuts off after 6 hours of simulation time.
#
# !!! info "The flux convention in Oceananigans.jl"
#     Fluxes are defined by the direction a quantity is carried: _positive_ velocities
#     produce _positive_ fluxes, while _negative_ velocities produce _negative_ fluxes.
#     Diffusive fluxes are defined with the same convention. A positive flux at the _top_
#     boundary transports buoyancy _upwards, out of the domain_. This means that a positive
#     flux of buoyancy at the top boundary reduces the buoyancy of near-surface fluid,
#     causing convection.
#
# The initial condition and bottom boundary condition impose the constant buoyancy gradient

N² = 1e-4 # s⁻²

buoyancy_gradient_bc = GradientBoundaryCondition(N²)

# In summary, the buoyancy boundary conditions impose a destabilizing flux
# at the top and a stable buoyancy gradient at the bottom:

buoyancy_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(top = buoyancy_flux_bc, bottom = buoyancy_gradient_bc)

# and Coriolis forces appropriate for planktonic convection at mid-latitudes on Earth.

#     For example, smaller outputs that consume less disk space may be written more
#     frequently without threatening the capacity of your hard drive.
#     An arbitrary number of output writers may be added to `simulation.output_writers`.
