#
# This example demonstrates
#
#   * How to run large eddy simulations with surface wave effects via the
#     Craik-Leibovich approximation.
#
#   * How to specify time- and horizontally-averaged output.

# ## Install dependencies
#
# First let's make sure we have all required packages installed.

# ```julia
# using Pkg
# pkg"add Oceananigans, JLD2, Plots"
# ```

using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.Units: minute, minutes, hours

# ## Model set-up
#
# To build the model, we specify the grid, Stokes drift, boundary conditions, and
# Coriolis parameter.
#
# ### Domain and numerical grid specification
#
# We create a grid with modest resolution. The grid extent is similar, but not
# exactly the same as that in McWilliams et al. (1997).

grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(32, 32, 48), extent=(128, 128, 96))

# ### The Stokes Drift profile
#
# The surface wave Stokes drift profile prescribed in McWilliams et al. (1997)
# corresponds to a 'monochromatic' (that is, single-frequency) wave field.
#
# A monochromatic wave field is characterized by its wavelength and amplitude
# (half the distance from wave crest to wave trough), which determine the wave
# frequency and the vertical scale of the Stokes drift profile.

using Oceananigans.BuoyancyModels: g_Earth

 amplitude = 0.8 # m
wavelength = 60 # m
wavenumber = 2π / wavelength # m⁻¹
 frequency = sqrt(g_Earth * wavenumber) # s⁻¹

## The vertical scale over which the Stokes drift of a monochromatic surface wave
## decays away from the surface is `1/2wavenumber`, or
const vertical_scale = wavelength / 4π

## Stokes drift velocity at the surface
const Uˢ = amplitude^2 * wavenumber * frequency # m s⁻¹

# The `const` declarations ensure that Stokes drift functions compile on the GPU.
# To run this example on the GPU, write `architecture = GPU()` in the constructor
# for `NonhydrostaticModel` below.
#
# The Stokes drift profile is

uˢ(z) = Uˢ * exp(z / vertical_scale)

# which we'll need for the initial condition.
#
# !!! info "The Craik-Leibovich equations in Oceananigans"
#     Oceananigans implements the Craik-Leibovich approximation for surface wave effects
#     using the _Lagrangian-mean_ velocity field as its prognostic momentum variable.
#     In other words, `model.velocities.u` is the Lagrangian-mean ``x``-velocity beneath surface
#     waves. This differs from models that use the _Eulerian-mean_ velocity field
#     as a prognostic variable, but has the advantage that ``u`` accounts for the total advection
#     of tracers and momentum, and that ``u = v = w = 0`` is a steady solution even when Coriolis
#     forces are present. See the
#     [physics documentation](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/physics/surface_gravity_waves/)
#     for more information.
#
# The vertical derivative of the Stokes drift is

∂z_uˢ(z, t) = 1 / vertical_scale * Uˢ * exp(z / vertical_scale)

# Finally, we note that the time-derivative of the Stokes drift must be provided
# if the Stokes drift changes in time. In this example, the Stokes drift is constant
# and thus the time-derivative of the Stokes drift is 0.

# ### Boundary conditions
#
# At the surface at ``z=0``, McWilliams et al. (1997) impose a wind stress
# on ``u``,

Qᵘ = -3.72e-5 # m² s⁻², surface kinematic momentum flux

u_boundary_conditions = FieldBoundaryConditions(top = FluxBoundaryCondition(Qᵘ))

# McWilliams et al. (1997) impose a linear buoyancy gradient `N²` at the bottom
# along with a weak, destabilizing flux of buoyancy at the surface to faciliate
# spin-up from rest.

Qᵇ = 2.307e-9 # m³ s⁻², surface buoyancy flux
N² = 1.936e-5 # s⁻², initial and bottom buoyancy gradient

b_boundary_conditions = FieldBoundaryConditions(top = FluxBoundaryCondition(Qᵇ),
                                                bottom = GradientBoundaryCondition(N²))

# !!! info "The flux convention in Oceananigans"
#     Note that Oceananigans uses "positive upward" conventions for all fluxes. In consequence,
#     a negative flux at the surface drives positive velocities, and a positive flux of
#     buoyancy drives cooling.

# ### Coriolis parameter
#
# McWilliams et al. (1997) use

coriolis = FPlane(f=1e-4) # s⁻¹

# which is typical for mid-latitudes on Earth.

# ## Model instantiation
#
# We are ready to build the model. We use a fifth-order Weighted Essentially
# Non-Oscillatory (WENO) advection scheme and the `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`
# model for large eddy simulation. Because our Stokes drift does not vary in ``x, y``,
# we use `UniformStokesDrift`, which expects Stokes drift functions of ``z, t`` only.

model = NonhydrostaticModel(
              advection = WENO5(),
            timestepper = :RungeKutta3,
                   grid = grid,
                tracers = :b,
               buoyancy = BuoyancyTracer(),
               coriolis = coriolis,
                closure = AnisotropicMinimumDissipation(),
           stokes_drift = UniformStokesDrift(∂z_uˢ=∂z_uˢ),
    boundary_conditions = (u=u_boundary_conditions, b=b_boundary_conditions),
)

# ## Initial conditions
#
# We make use of random noise concentrated in the upper 4 meters
# for buoyancy and velocity initial conditions,

Ξ(z) = randn() * exp(z / 4)
nothing # hide

# Our initial condition for buoyancy consists of a surface mixed layer 33 m deep,
# a deep linear stratification, plus noise,

initial_mixed_layer_depth = 33 # m
stratification(z) = z < - initial_mixed_layer_depth ? N² * z : N² * (-initial_mixed_layer_depth)

bᵢ(x, y, z) = stratification(z) + 1e-1 * Ξ(z) * N² * model.grid.Lz

# The velocity initial condition in McWilliams et al. (1997) is zero *Eulerian-mean* velocity.
# This means that we must add the Stokes drift profile to the Lagrangian-mean ``u`` velocity field
# modeled by Oceananigans.jl. We also add noise scaled by the friction velocity to ``u`` and ``w``.

uᵢ(x, y, z) = uˢ(z) + sqrt(abs(Qᵘ)) * 1e-1 * Ξ(z)

wᵢ(x, y, z) = sqrt(abs(Qᵘ)) * 1e-1 * Ξ(z)

# ## Setting up the simulation

wizard = TimeStepWizard(cfl=1.0, max_change=1.1, max_Δt=1minute)

simulation.callbacks[:wizard] = Callback(wizard, IterationInterval(10))

#
# We define a function that prints a helpful message with
# maximum absolute value of ``u, v, w`` and the current wall clock time.
