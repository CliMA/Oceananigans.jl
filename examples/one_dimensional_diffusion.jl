# # [Simple diffusion example]](@id one_dimensional_diffusion_example)
#
# This is Oceananigans.jl's simplest example:
# the diffusion of a one-dimensional Gaussian. This example demonstrates
#
#   * How to load `Oceananigans.jl`.
#   * How to instantiate an `Oceananigans.jl` model.
#   * How to create simple `Oceananigans.jl` output.
#   * How to set an initial condition with a function.
#   * How to time-step a model forward.
#   * How to look at results.
#
# ## Install dependencies
#
# First let's make sure we have all required packages installed.

# ```julia
# using Pkg
# pkg"add Oceananigans, CairoMakie"
# ```

# ## Using `Oceananigans.jl`
#
# Write

using Oceananigans

# to load Oceananigans functions and objects into our script.
#
# ## Instantiating and configuring a model
#
# A core Oceananigans type is `NonhydrostaticModel`. We build a `NonhydrostaticModel`
# by passing it a `grid`, plus information about the equations we would like to solve.
#
# Below, we build a rectilinear grid with 128 regularly-spaced grid points in
# the `z`-direction, where `z` spans from `z = -0.5` to `z = 0.5`,

grid = RectilinearGrid(size=128, z=(-0.5, 0.5), topology=(Flat, Flat, Bounded))

# The default topology is `(Periodic, Periodic, Bounded)`. In this example, we're
# trying to solve a one-dimensional problem, so we assign `Flat` to the
# `x` and `y` topologies. We excise halos and avoid interpolation or differencing
# in `Flat` directions, saving computation and memory.
#
# We next specify a model with an `ScalarDiffusivity`, which models either
# molecular or turbulent diffusion,

closure = ScalarDiffusivity(κ=1)

# We finally pass these two ingredients to `NonhydrostaticModel`,

model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, closure, tracers=:T)

# By default, `NonhydrostaticModel` has no-flux (insulating and stress-free) boundary conditions on
# all fields.
#
# Next, we `set!` an initial condition on the temperature field,
# `model.tracers.T`. Our objective is to observe the diffusion of a Gaussian.

width = 0.1
initial_temperature(x, y, z) = exp(-z^2 / (2width^2))
set!(model, T=initial_temperature)

# ## Visualizing model data
#
# Calling `set!` above changes the data contained in `model.tracers.T`,
# which was initialized as `0`'s when the model was created.
# To see the new data in `model.tracers.T`, we plot it:

using CairoMakie
set_theme!(Theme(fontsize = 24, linewidth=3))

fig = Figure()
axis = (xlabel = "Temperature (ᵒC)", ylabel = "z")
label = "t = 0"

z = znodes(model.tracers.T)
T = interior(model.tracers.T, 1, 1, :)

lines(T, z; label, axis)
current_figure() #hide

# The function `interior` above extracts a `view` of `model.tracers.T` over the
# physical points (excluding halos) at `(1, 1, :)`.
#
# ## Running a `Simulation`
#
# Next we set-up a `Simulation` that time-steps the model forward and manages output.

## Time-scale for diffusion across a grid cell
min_Δz = minimum_zspacing(model.grid)
diffusion_time_scale = min_Δz^2 / model.closure.κ.T

simulation = Simulation(model, Δt = 0.1 * diffusion_time_scale, stop_iteration = 1000)

# `simulation` will run for 1000 iterations with a time-step that resolves the time-scale
# at which our temperature field diffuses. All that's left is to

run!(simulation)

# ## Visualizing the results
#
# Let's look at how `model.tracers.T` changed during the simulation.

using Printf

label = @sprintf("t = %.3f", model.clock.time)
lines!(interior(model.tracers.T, 1, 1, :), z; label)
axislegend()
current_figure() #hide

# Very interesting! Next, we run the simulation a bit longer and make an animation.
# For this, we use the `JLD2OutputWriter` to write data to disk as the simulation progresses.

simulation.output_writers[:temperature] =
    JLD2OutputWriter(model, model.tracers,
                     filename = "one_dimensional_diffusion.jld2",
                     schedule=IterationInterval(100),
                     overwrite_existing = true)

# We run the simulation for 10,000 more iterations,

simulation.stop_iteration += 10000
run!(simulation)

# Finally, we animate the results by opening the JLD2 file, extract the
# iterations we ended up saving at, and plot the evolution of the
# temperature profile in a loop over the iterations.

T_timeseries = FieldTimeSeries("one_dimensional_diffusion.jld2", "T")
times = T_timeseries.times

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[2, 1]; xlabel = "Temperature (ᵒC)", ylabel = "z")
xlims!(ax, 0, 1)

n = Observable(1)

T = @lift interior(T_timeseries[$n], 1, 1, :)
lines!(T, z)

label = @lift "t = " * string(round(times[$n], digits=3))

# Finally, we record a movie.
