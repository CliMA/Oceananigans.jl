# # An unstable Bickley jet in Shallow Water model 
#
# This example shows how to use `Oceananigans.ShallowWaterModel` to simulate
# the evolution of an unstable, geostrophically balanced, Bickley jet.
# The model solves the governing equations for the shallow water model in
# conservative form.  The geometry is that of a periodic channel
# in the ``x``-direction with a flat bottom and a free-surface. The initial
# conditions are that of a Bickley jet with small-amplitude perturbations.
# The interested reader can see ["The nonlinear evolution of barotropically unstable jets," J. Phys. Oceanogr. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(2003)033<2173:TNEOBU>2.0.CO;2)
# for more details on this specific problem. 
#
# Unlike the other models, the fields that are simulated are the mass transports, 
# ``uh`` and ``vh`` in the ``x`` and ``y`` directions, respectively,
# and the height ``h``.  Note that the velocities ``u`` and ``v`` are not state 
# variables but can be easily computed when needed, e.g., via `u = uh / h`.
#
# ## Install dependencies
#
# First we make sure that we have all of the packages that are required to
# run the simulation.
# ```julia
# using Pkg
# pkg"add Oceananigans, NCDatasets, Plots, Printf, Polynomials"
# ```

# ## Two-dimensional domain 
#
# The shallow water model is a two-dimensional model and thus the number of vertical
# points `Nz` must be set to one.  Note that ``L_z`` is the mean depth of the fluid.

# ## Physical parameters
#
# This is a toy problem and we choose the parameters so the jet idealizes a relatively narrow 
# mesoscale jet. The physical parameters are
#
#   * ``f``: Coriolis parameter
#   * ``g``: Acceleration due to gravity
#   * ``U``: Maximum jet speed
#   * ``\Delta \eta``: Maximum free-surface deformation as dictated by geostrophy

# ## Building a `ShallowWaterModel`
#
# We use `grid`, `coriolis` and `gravitational_acceleration` to build the model.
# Furthermore, we specify `RungeKutta3` for time-stepping and `WENO5` for advection.

    timestepper=:RungeKutta3,

# ## Background state and perturbation
#
# The background velocity ``ū`` and free-surface ``η̄`` are chosen to represent a 
# geostrophically balanced Bickely jet with maximum speed of ``U`` and maximum 
# free-surface deformation of ``Δη``, i.e.,
#
# ```math
# \begin{align}
# η̄(y) & = - Δη \tanh(y) , \\
# ū(y) & = U \mathrm{sech}^2(y) .
# \end{align}
# ```
#
# The total height of the fluid is ``h = L_z + \eta``. Linear stability theory predicts that 
# for the parameters we consider here, the growth rate for the most unstable mode that fits 
# our domain is approximately ``0.139``.
# 
# We also specify `ω̄` as the vorticity of the background state, 
# ``ω̄ = - ∂_y ū = 2 U \mathrm{sech}^2(y) \tanh(y)``.

h̄(x, y, z) = Lz - Δη * tanh(y)

# ## Running a `Simulation`
#
# We pick the time-step so that we make sure we resolve the surface gravity waves, which 
# propagate with speed of the order ``\sqrt{g L_z}``. That is, with `Δt = 1e-2` we ensure 
# that `` \sqrt{g L_z} Δt / Δx,  \sqrt{g L_z} Δt / Δy < 0.7``.
