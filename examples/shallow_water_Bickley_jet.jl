# # An unstable Bickley jet in Shallow Water model 
#
# This example uses Oceananigans.jl's `ShallowWaterModel` to simulate
# the evolution of an unstable, geostrophically balanced, Bickley jet
# The example is periodic in ``x`` with flat bathymetry and
# uses the conservative formulation of the shallow water equations.
# The initial conditions superpose the Bickley jet with small-amplitude perturbations.
# See ["The nonlinear evolution of barotropically unstable jets," J. Phys. Oceanogr. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(2003)033<2173:TNEOBU>2.0.CO;2)

# The mass transport ``(uh, vh)`` is the prognostic momentum variable
# in the conservative formulation of the shallow water equations,
# where ``(u, v)`` are the horizontal velocity components and ``h``
# is the layer height. 
#
# ## Install dependencies
#
# First we make sure that we have all of the packages that are required to
# run the simulation.

# ## Two-dimensional domain 
#
# The shallow water model is two-dimensional and uses grids that are `Flat`
# in the vertical direction. We use length scales non-dimensionalized by the width
# of the Bickley jet.

grid = RectilinearGrid(size = (48, 128),
                       x = (0, 2π),
                       y = (-10, 10),
                       topology = (Periodic, Bounded, Flat))

# ## Building a `ShallowWaterModel`
#
# We build a `ShallowWaterModel` with the `WENO` advection scheme,
# 3rd-order Runge-Kutta time-stepping, non-dimensional Coriolis, and
# gravitational acceleration

gravitational_acceleration = 1
coriolis = FPlane(f=1)

model = ShallowWaterModel(; grid, coriolis, gravitational_acceleration,
                          timestepper = :RungeKutta3,
                          momentum_advection = WENO())

# ## Background state and perturbation
#
# The background velocity ``ū`` and free-surface ``η̄`` correspond to a
# geostrophically balanced Bickely jet with maximum speed of ``U`` and maximum 
# free-surface deformation of ``Δη``,

U = 1  # Maximum jet velocity
H = 10 # Reference depth
f = coriolis.f
g = gravitational_acceleration
Δη = f * U / g  # Maximum free-surface deformation as dictated by geostrophy

h̄(x, y) = H - Δη * tanh(y)
ū(x, y) = U * sech(y)^2

# The total height of the fluid is ``h = L_z + \eta``. Linear stability theory predicts that 
# for the parameters we consider here, the growth rate for the most unstable mode that fits 
# our domain is approximately ``0.139``.

# The vorticity of the background state is

ω̄(x, y) = 2 * U * sech(y)^2 * tanh(y)

# The initial conditions include a small-amplitude perturbation that decays away from the 
# center of the jet.

small_amplitude = 1e-4
 
 uⁱ(x, y) = ū(x, y) + small_amplitude * exp(-y^2) * randn()
uhⁱ(x, y) = uⁱ(x, y) * h̄(x, y)

# We first set a "clean" initial condition without noise for the purpose of discretely
# calculating the initial 'mean' vorticity,

ū̄h(x, y) = ū(x, y) * h̄(x, y)

set!(model, uh = ū̄h, h = h̄)

# We next compute the initial vorticity and perturbation vorticity,

uh, vh, h = model.solution

## Build velocities
u = uh / h
v = vh / h

## Build and compute mean vorticity discretely
ω = Field(∂x(v) - ∂y(u))
compute!(ω)

## Copy mean vorticity to a new field
ωⁱ = Field((Face, Face, Nothing), model.grid)
ωⁱ .= ω

## Use this new field to compute the perturbation vorticity
ω′ = Field(ω - ωⁱ)

# and finally set the "true" initial condition with noise,

set!(model, uh = uhⁱ)

# ## Running a `Simulation`
#
# We pick the time-step so that we make sure we resolve the surface gravity waves, which 
# propagate with speed of the order ``\sqrt{g H}``. That is, with `Δt = 1e-2` we ensure 
# that `` \sqrt{g H} Δt / Δx,  \sqrt{g H} Δt / Δy < 0.7``.

#
# Define a function to compute the norm of the perturbation on the cross channel velocity.
# We obtain the `norm` function from `LinearAlgebra`.
