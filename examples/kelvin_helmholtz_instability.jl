# ## The physical domain
#
# We simulate a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in two-dimensions in ``x, z``
# and therefore assign `Flat` to the `y` direction,

using Oceananigans

                       topology=(Periodic, Flat, Bounded))

# # The basic state
#
# We're simulating the instability of a sheared and stably-stratified basic state
# ``U(z)`` and ``B(z)``. Two parameters define our basic state: the Richardson number,
#
# ```math
# Ri = \frac{∂_z B}{(∂_z U)^2} ,
# ```
#
# and the width of the stratification layer, ``h``.

shear_flow(x, z, t) = tanh(z)

stratification(x, z, t, p) = p.h * p.Ri * tanh(z / p.h)

U = BackgroundField(shear_flow)

B = BackgroundField(stratification, parameters=(Ri=0.1, h=1/4))

# Our basic state thus has a thin layer of stratification in the center of
# the channel, embedded within a thicker shear layer surrounded by unstratified fluid.

zC = znodes(grid, Center())

# In unstable flows it is often useful to determine the dominant spatial structure of the
# instability and the growth rate at which the instability grows.
# If the simulation idealizes a physical flow, this can be used to make
# predictions as to what should develop and how quickly.
# Since these instabilities are often attributed to a linear instability,
# we can determine information about the structure and the growth rate of the instability by analyzing the linear operator
# that governs small perturbations about a base state, or by solving for the linear dynamics.

# Here, we discuss first briefly linear instabilities and how one can obtain growth rates and structures of most unstable
# modes via eigenanalysis. Then we present an alternative method for approximating the eigenanalysis results when
# one does not have access to the linear dynamics or the linear operator about the base state.

# # Linear Instabilities
#
# The base state ``U(z)``, ``B(z)`` is a solution of the inviscid equations of motion. Whether the base state is
# stable or not is determined by whether small perturbations about this base state grow or decay. To formalize this,
# we study the linearized dynamics satisfied by perturbations about the base state:
# ```math
# \partial_t \Phi = L \Phi \, .
# ```
# where ``\Phi = (u, v, w, b)`` is a vector of the perturbation velocities ``u, v, w`` and perturbation buoyancy ``b``
# and ``L`` a linear operator that depends on the base state, ``L = L(U(z), B(z))`` (the `background_fields`).
# Eigenanalysis of the linear operator ``L`` determines the stability of the base state, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz
# instability. That is, by using the ansantz
# ```math
# \Phi(x, y, z, t) = \phi(x, y, z) \, \exp(\lambda t) \, ,
# ```
# then ``\lambda`` and ``\phi`` are respectively eigenvalues and eigenmodes of ``L``, i.e., they obey
# ```math
# L \, \phi_j = \lambda_j \, \phi_j \quad j=1,2,\dots \, .
# ```
# From hereafter we'll use the convention that the eigenvalues are ordered according to their real part,
# ``\mathrm{Re}(\lambda_1) \ge \mathrm{Re}(\lambda_2) \ge \dotsb``.
#
# Remarks:
#
# As we touched upon briefly above, Oceananigans.jl, does not include the linearized version of the equations.
# Furthermore, Oceananigans.jl does not give us access to the linear operator ``L`` so that we can perform eigenanalysis.
# Below we discuss an alternative way of approximating the eigenanalysis results.
# The method boils down to solving the nonlinear equations while continually renormalize
# the magnitude of the perturbations to ensure that nonlinear terms
# (terms that are quadratic or higher in perturbations) remain negligibly small,
# i.e.,much smaller than the background flow.

# # The power method algorithm
#
# Successive application of ``L`` to a random initial state will eventually render it parallel
# with eigenmode ``\phi_1``:
# ```math
# \lim_{n \to \infty} L^n \Phi \propto \phi_1 \, .
# ```
# Of course, if ``\phi_1`` is an unstable mode (i.e., ``\sigma_1 = \mathrm{Re}(\lambda_1) > 0``), then successive application
# of ``L`` will lead to exponential amplification. (Similarly, if ``\sigma_1 < 0``, successive application of ``L`` will
# lead to exponential decay of ``\Phi`` down to machine precision.) Therefore, after each
# application of the linear operator ``L``, we rescale the output ``L \Phi`` back to a pre-selected amplitude.
#
# So, we initialize a `simulation` with random initial conditions with amplitude much less than those of
# the base state (which are ``O(1)``). Instead of "applying" ``L`` on our initial state, we evolve the
# (approximately) linear dynamics for interval ``\Delta \tau``. We measure how much the energy has grown
# during that interval, rescale the perturbations back to original energy amplitude and repeat.
# After some iterations the state will converge to the most unstable eigenmode.
#
# In summary, each iteration of the power method includes:
# - compute the perturbation energy, ``E_0``,
# - evolve the system for a time-interval ``\Delta \tau``,
# - compute the perturbation energy, ``E_1``,
# - determine the exponential growth of the most unstable mode during the interval
#   ``\Delta \tau`` as  ``\log(E_1 / E_0) / (2 \Delta \tau)``,
# - repeat the above until growth rate converges.
#
# By fiddling a bit with ``\Delta t`` we can get convergence after only a few iterations.
#
# Let's apply all these to our example.
