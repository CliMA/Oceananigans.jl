Oceananigans is a fast, friendly, flexible software package for finite volume simulations of the nonhydrostatic
and hydrostatic Boussinesq equations on CPUs and GPUs.
It runs on GPUs (wow, fast!), though we believe Oceananigans makes the biggest waves
with its ultra-flexible user interface that makes simple simulations easy, and complex, creative simulations possible.

Oceananigans.jl is developed by the [Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu) and heroic external collaborators.

## Installation instructions

Oceananigans is a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). So to install it,

1. [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

2. Launch Julia and type

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("Oceananigans")
```

## Running your first model

Let's run a two-dimensional, horizontally-periodic simulation of turbulence using 128Â² finite volume cells for 4 non-dimensional time units:

```julia
using Oceananigans
grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(), size=(128, 128), x=(0, 2Ï€), y=(0, 2Ï€), topology=(Periodic, Periodic, Flat))
model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, advection=WENO5())
Ïµ(x, y, z) = 2rand() - 1
set!(model, u=Ïµ, v=Ïµ)
simulation = Simulation(model; Î”t=0.01, stop_time=4)
run!(simulation)
```

That's it! Even better, changing `CPU()` to `GPU()` makes this code on a CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPU.

Dive into [the documentation](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/) for more code examples and tutorials.
You can see some movies from GPU simulations below along with CPU and GPU [performance benchmarks](https://github.com/clima/Oceananigans.jl#performance-benchmarks).

## The Oceananigans knowledge base

It's _deep_ and includes:

* [Documentation](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable) that provides
    * example Oceananigans scripts,
    * tutorials that describe key Oceananigans objects and functions,
    * explanations of Oceananigans finite-volume-based numerical methods,
    * details of the dynamical equations solved by Oceananigans models, and
    * a library documenting all user-facing Oceananigans objects and functions.
* [Discussions on the Oceananigans github](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/discussions), covering topics like
    * ["Computational science"](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/discussions/categories/computational-science), or how to science and set up numerical simulations in Oceananigans, and
    * ["Experimental features"](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/discussions?discussions_q=experimental+features), which covers new and sparsely-documented features for those who like to live dangerously.
  
    If you've got a question or something to talk about, don't hestitate to [start a new discussion](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/discussions/new?)!
* The [Oceananigans wiki](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/wiki) contains practical tips for [getting started with Julia](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/wiki/Installation-and-getting-started-with-Oceananigans), [accessing and using GPUs](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/wiki/Oceananigans-on-GPUs), and [productive workflows when using Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/wiki/Productive-Oceananigans-workflows-and-Julia-environments).
* The `#oceananigans` channel on the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/), which accesses "institutional knowledge" stored in the minds of the amazing Oceananigans community.
* [Issues](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pulls) also contain lots of information about problems we've found, solutions we're trying to implement, and dreams we're dreaming to make tomorrow better ðŸŒˆ.

## Performance benchmarks

We've performed some preliminary performance benchmarks (see the [performance benchmarks](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/appendix/benchmarks/) section of the documentation) by initializing models of various sizes and measuring the wall clock time taken per model iteration (or time step).

This is not really a fair comparison as we haven't parallelized across all the CPU's cores so we will revisit these benchmarks once Oceananigans.jl can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs.

To make full use of or fully saturate the computing power of a GPU such as an Nvidia Tesla V100 or
a Titan V, the model should have around ~10 million grid points or more.

Sometimes counter-intuitively running with `Float32` is slower than `Float64`. This is likely due
to type mismatches causing slowdowns as floats have to be converted between 32-bit and 64-bit, an
issue that needs to be addressed meticulously. Due to other bottlenecks such as memory accesses and
GPU register pressure, `Float32` models may not provide much of a speedup so the main benefit becomes
lower memory costs (by around a factor of 2).
