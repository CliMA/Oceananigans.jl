# Contributors Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to Oceananigans! 

Please feel free to ask us questions and chat with us at any time if you're
unsure about anything.

Best way to get in touch is to either just open a GitHub issue (don't be shy!) or
to drop by the #oceananigans channel on the Julia Slack (see
[https://julialang.org/slack/](https://julialang.org/slack/)).

We follow the [ColPrac guide](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac) for collaborative
practices. New contributors should make sure to read that guide.

## What can I do?

* Tackle an existing issue. We keep a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/CLiMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  that are self-contained and suitable for a newcomer to try and work on.

* Try to run Oceananigans and play around with it to simulate your favorite
  fluids and ocean physics. If you run into any bugs/problems or find it difficult
  to use or understand, please open an issue!

* Write up an example or tutorial on how to do something useful with
  Oceananigans, like how to set up a new physical configuration.

* Improve documentation or comments if you found something hard to use.

* Implement a new feature if you need it to use Oceananigans.

If you're interested in working on something, let us know by commenting on
existing issues or by opening a new issue. This is to make sure no one else
is working on the same issue and so we can help and guide you in case there
is anything you need to know beforehand.

We also hang out on the #oceananigans channel on Julia Slack, which is a great
place to discuss anything Oceananigans-related, especially contributions! To
join the Julia Slack, go to [https://julialang.org/slack/](https://julialang.org/slack/).
